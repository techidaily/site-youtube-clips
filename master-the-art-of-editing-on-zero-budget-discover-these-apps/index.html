<p>What makes a YouTube video good? The most important element is obviously you, the creator. Your personality, ideas, and unique viewpoint are what will make your content special and turn viewers into subscribers.</p>
<p>The next most important thing – even more important than the camera you use – is editing.</p>
<p>Editing a YouTube video doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, it should be simple. Your focus when you’re perfecting your video should be on that ‘most important thing’ we mentioned earlier – your creativity. Editing for a YouTube video should be art, not mechanical engineering.</p>

<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Includes transitions</li>
<li>Keyframing</li>
<li>Alpha Channel</li>
<li>Unlimited video tracks</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="OpenShot-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#OpenShot-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="OpenShot Video Editor Review"></a><strong>OpenShot Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>OpenShot completely lives up to the claim that it was designed to be ‘easy to use, quick to learn, and surprisingly powerful’.</p>
<p>The first time you use OpenShot there will be helpful tutorial notes to guide you through the program. The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p>
<p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p>
<p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p>
<p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p>
<p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p>
<h2 id="2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux"><a href="#2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux" class="headerlink" title="2. Shotcut – Open Source (Windows, Mac, Linux)"></a><strong>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Open Source (Windows, Mac, Linux)</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Detailed audio editing</li>
<li>Color grading, ability to save presets</li>
<li>Fairly intuitive timeline</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Shotcut-Review"><a href="#Shotcut-Review" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p>
<p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p>
<p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p>
<h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p>
<p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p>
<h2 id="3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac"><a href="#3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. Hitfilm Express – Windows, Mac"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hitfilm.com/express" >Hitfilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Windows, Mac</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Compositing mode (2D and 3D)</li>
<li>The Most effect customization</li>
<li>Helpful User Guide &amp; tutorials</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Can be overwhelming</li>
<li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p>
<p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p>
<p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p>
<p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p>

<h4 id="VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="VideoPad Video Editor Review"></a><strong>VideoPad Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>VideoPad Video Editor is an extremely easy to use program. It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p>
<p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p>
<p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p>
<p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p>
<p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p>

<h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Exports limited to 720p for the free version</li>
<li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Lightworks-Review"><a href="#Lightworks-Review" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p>
<p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p>
<p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p>
<p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p>
<p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p>

<h4 id="Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor"><a href="#Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Review of VSDC Video Editor"></a><strong>Review of VSDC Video Editor</strong></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about VSDC Video Editor, but you have to do a lot of work to uncover any of it. Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p>
<p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p>
<p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p>
<h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="7.

<li>Great for harvesting clips from longer footage</li>
<li>Lossless exports</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Cannot swap or add audio</li>
<li>Only supports two formats (AVI and WMV)</li>
<li>Slightly awkward timeline</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p>
<p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p>
<p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p>
<p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p>
<p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p>

<li>Not intuitive</li>
<li>Doesn’t support MOV or WMV</li>
<li>The website is not informative, no tutorials</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Avidemux-Review"><a href="#Avidemux-Review" class="headerlink" title="Avidemux Review"></a><strong>Avidemux Review</strong></h4><p>Avidemux is not an easy program to jump into. I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p>
<p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p>
<p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p>
<p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p>

<p>What makes a YouTube video good? The most important element is obviously you, the creator. Your personality, ideas, and unique viewpoint are what will make your content special and turn viewers into subscribers.</p>
<p>The next most important thing – even more important than the camera you use – is editing.</p>
<p>Editing a YouTube video doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, it should be simple. Your focus when you’re perfecting your video should be on that ‘most important thing’ we mentioned earlier – your creativity. Editing for a YouTube video should be art, not mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>The first time you use OpenShot there will be helpful tutorial notes to guide you through the program. The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p>
<p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p>
<p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p>
<p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p>
<p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="Shotcut-Review-1"><a href="#Shotcut-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p>
<p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p>
<p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p>
<h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p>
<p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p>

<h4 id="Cons-6"><a href="#Cons-6" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Can be overwhelming</li>
<li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review-1"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p>
<p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p>
<p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p>
<p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p>

<h4 id="VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review-1"><a href="#VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="VideoPad Video Editor Review"></a><strong>VideoPad Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>VideoPad Video Editor is an extremely easy to use program. It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p>
<p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p>
<p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p>
<p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p>
<p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p>

<h4 id="Cons-8"><a href="#Cons-8" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Exports limited to 720p for the free version</li>
<li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Lightworks-Review-1"><a href="#Lightworks-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p>
<p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p>
<p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p>
<p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p>
<p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p>

<h4 id="Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Review of VSDC Video Editor"></a><strong>Review of VSDC Video Editor</strong></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about VSDC Video Editor, but you have to do a lot of work to uncover any of it. Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p>
<p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p>
<p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p>
<h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-1"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

<li>Great for harvesting clips from longer footage</li>
<li>Lossless exports</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Cons-10"><a href="#Cons-10" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Cannot swap or add audio</li>
<li>Only supports two formats (AVI and WMV)</li>
<li>Slightly awkward timeline</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review-1"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p>
<p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p>
<p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p>
<p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p>
<p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p>
<h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-1"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-1" class="headerlink" title="8.

</ol>
<h4 id="Avidemux-Review-1"><a href="#Avidemux-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Avidemux Review"></a><strong>Avidemux Review</strong></h4><p>Avidemux is not an easy program to jump into. I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p>
<p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p>
<p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p>
<p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p>

<p>What makes a YouTube video good? The most important element is obviously you, the creator. Your personality, ideas, and unique viewpoint are what will make your content special and turn viewers into subscribers.</p>
<p>The next most important thing – even more important than the camera you use – is editing.</p>
<p>Editing a YouTube video doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, it should be simple. Your focus when you’re perfecting your video should be on that ‘most important thing’ we mentioned earlier – your creativity. Editing for a YouTube video should be art, not mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>The first time you use OpenShot there will be helpful tutorial notes to guide you through the program. The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p>
<p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p>
<p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p>
<p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p>
<p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="Shotcut-Review-2"><a href="#Shotcut-Review-2" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p>
<p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p>
<p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p>
<h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p>
<p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p>

<h4 id="Cons-12"><a href="#Cons-12" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Can be overwhelming</li>
<li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review-2"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review-2" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p>
<p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p>
<p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p>
<p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p>

It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p>
<p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p>
<p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p>
<p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p>
<p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p>

<li>Detailed color and audio editing</li>
<li>Multicam editing</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Cons-14"><a href="#Cons-14" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Exports limited to 720p for the free version</li>
<li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Lightworks-Review-2"><a href="#Lightworks-Review-2" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p>
<p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p>
<p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p>
<p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p>
<p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p>

<h4 id="Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="Review of VSDC Video Editor"></a><strong>Review of VSDC Video Editor</strong></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about VSDC Video Editor, but you have to do a lot of work to uncover any of it. Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p>
<p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p>
<p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p>
<h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-2"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

<li>Great for harvesting clips from longer footage</li>
<li>Lossless exports</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Cons-16"><a href="#Cons-16" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Cannot swap or add audio</li>
<li>Only supports two formats (AVI and WMV)</li>
<li>Slightly awkward timeline</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review-2"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review-2" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p>
<p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p>
<p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p>
<p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p>
<p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p>
<h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-2"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

</ol>
<h4 id="Avidemux-Review-2"><a href="#Avidemux-Review-2" class="headerlink" title="Avidemux Review"></a><strong>Avidemux Review</strong></h4><p>Avidemux is not an easy program to jump into. I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p>
<p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p>
<p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p>
<p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p>

<p>What makes a YouTube video good? The most important element is obviously you, the creator. Your personality, ideas, and unique viewpoint are what will make your content special and turn viewers into subscribers.</p>
<p>The next most important thing – even more important than the camera you use – is editing.</p>
<p>Editing a YouTube video doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, it should be simple. Your focus when you’re perfecting your video should be on that ‘most important thing’ we mentioned earlier – your creativity. Editing for a YouTube video should be art, not mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>The first time you use OpenShot there will be helpful tutorial notes to guide you through the program. The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p>
<p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p>
<p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p>
<p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p>
<p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="Shotcut-Review-3"><a href="#Shotcut-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p>
<p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p>
<p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p>
<h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p>
<p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="Cons-18"><a href="#Cons-18" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>
<li>Can be overwhelming</li>
<li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review-3"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p>
<p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p>
<p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p>
<p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p>
<p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p>

It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them).

<p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p>
<p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p>
<p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p>
<p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p>

<h4 id="Cons-20"><a href="#Cons-20" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol>

<li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Lightworks-Review-3"><a href="#Lightworks-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p>
<p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p>
<p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p>
<p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p>
<p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p>

<h4 id="Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Review of VSDC Video Editor"></a><strong>Review of VSDC Video Editor</strong></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about VSDC Video Editor, but you have to do a lot of work to uncover any of it. Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p>
<p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p>
<p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p>
<h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p>
<h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-3"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

<h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review-3"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p>
<p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p>
<p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p>
<p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p>
<p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="Avidemux-Review-3"><a href="#Avidemux-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="Avidemux Review"></a><strong>Avidemux Review</strong></h4><p>Avidemux is not an easy program to jump into. I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p>
<p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p>
<p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p>
<h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p>
<p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p>

<p><em>The following is a complete guide to YouTube banners, including instructions, tips, and free resources.</em></p>
<p>Channel art isn’t hard. Making video viewers enjoy enough that they click on your channel page - that’s hard. Channel art is just about reinforcing the positive feelings viewers have come away from your videos. Anyone who’s looking at your channel art is already thinking about subscribing to you. Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p>

<h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p>
<p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p>
<p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p>
<p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p>
<p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p>
<p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p>
<p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"
                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"
                ></p>
<p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p>
<h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p>
<p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p>
<p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p>
<h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p>
<p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p>
<p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p>
<p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unsplash.com/"><strong>Unsplash:</strong></a> This site has a huge selection, and more photos are being added all the time. Finding what you want is as easy as typing a keyword (i.e., ‘sunset’) into the search bar on the home page.</p>

                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p>
<p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p>
<p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p>
<p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p>
<p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p>
<p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p>
<p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p>
<h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p>
<p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p>
<p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p>
<p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p>
<p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p>
<p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p>
<p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p>
<p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Channel name</li>
<li>What kinds of videos you make</li>
<li>Your posting schedule</li>
<li>Social media handles</li>
<li>Your face</li>
<li>A tagline</li>

Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p>
<p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p>
<p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p>
<p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p>
<p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p>
<p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p>
<p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p>
<p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"
                      alt="color-implication"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p>
<p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p>
<p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p>
<p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li>
<li>Are you ever going to post again?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p>
<p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p>
<p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p>
<p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p>
<h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p>
<p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p>
<p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-minimalism.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"
                ></p>
<p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p>
<p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"
                ></p>
<p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p>
<p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p>
<p><strong>Funky</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"
                ></p>
<p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Comic</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p>
<p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone. It’s bold and communicates confidence. If your attitude towards YouTube is that you want to be fearless, why not go for something worthy of a superhuman?</p>

<p><em>The following is a complete guide to YouTube banners, including instructions, tips, and free resources.</em></p>
<p>Channel art isn’t hard. Making video viewers enjoy enough that they click on your channel page - that’s hard. Channel art is just about reinforcing the positive feelings viewers have come away from your videos. Anyone who’s looking at your channel art is already thinking about subscribing to you. Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p>

<h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics-1"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p>
<p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p>
<p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p>
<p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p>
<p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p>
<p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p>
<p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"
                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"
                ></p>
<p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p>
<h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources-1"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources-1" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-1"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p>
<p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p>
<p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p>
<h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts-1"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts-1" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p>
<p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p>
<p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p>
<p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners-1"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners-1" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p>
<p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p>
<p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p>
<p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p>
<p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern.jpg"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p>
<p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p>
<p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art-1"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art-1" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p>
<h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers-1"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers-1" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p>
<p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p>
<p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p>
<p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Wondershare PixStudio Banner Maker"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p>
<p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p>
<p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p>
<p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p>
<p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist-1"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist-1" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Channel name</li>
<li>What kinds of videos you make</li>
<li>Your posting schedule</li>
<li>Social media handles</li>
<li>Your face</li>
<li>A tagline</li>
</ol>

Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p>
<p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p>
<p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p>
<p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p>
<p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p>
<p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p>
<p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p>
<p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"
                      alt="color-implication"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p>
<p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p>
<p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p>
<p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li>
<li>Are you ever going to post again?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p>
<p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p>
<p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p>
<p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p>
<h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration-1"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration-1" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p>
<p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p>
<p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-minimalism.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"
                ></p>
<p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p>
<p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"
                ></p>
<p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p>
<p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p>
<p><strong>Funky</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"
                ></p>
<p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Comic</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p>
<p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone. It’s bold and communicates confidence. If your attitude towards YouTube is that you want to be fearless, why not go for something worthy of a superhuman?</p>

<p><em>The following is a complete guide to YouTube banners, including instructions, tips, and free resources.</em></p>
<p>Channel art isn’t hard. Making video viewers enjoy enough that they click on your channel page - that’s hard. Channel art is just about reinforcing the positive feelings viewers have come away from your videos. Anyone who’s looking at your channel art is already thinking about subscribing to you. Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p>

<h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics-2"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics-2" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p>
<p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p>
<p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p>
<p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p>
<p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p>
<p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p>
<p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"
                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"
                ></p>
<p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p>
<h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources-2"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources-2" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-2"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-2" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p>
<p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p>
<p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p>
<h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts-2"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts-2" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p>
<p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p>
<p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p>
<p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p>

                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unsplash.com/"><strong>Unsplash:</strong></a> This site has a huge selection, and more photos are being added all the time. Finding what you want is as easy as typing a keyword (i.e., ‘sunset’) into the search bar on the home page.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="free-youtube-banner-pexels"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners-2"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners-2" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p>
<p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p>
<p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p>
<p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p>
<p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern.jpg"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p>
<p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p>
<p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art-2"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art-2" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p>
<h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers-2"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers-2" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p>
<p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p>
<p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p>
<p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p>
<p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p>
<p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p>
<p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p>
<p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art-2"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist-2"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist-2" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Channel name</li>
<li>What kinds of videos you make</li>
<li>Your posting schedule</li>
<li>Social media handles</li>
<li>Your face</li>
<li>A tagline</li>
</ol>

Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#solidbackground">Solid Background Behind Text</a></li>
<li><a href="#minimaltext">Keep Text to a Minimum</a></li>
<li><a href="#imagesandcolors">Use Images and Colors That Suit Your Channel</a></li>
<li><a href="#face">Include Your Face</a></li>
<li><a href="#reason">Give Viewers a Reason To Subscribe</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p>
<p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p>
<p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p>
<p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p>
<p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p>
<p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p>
<p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p>
<p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"
                      alt="color-implication"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p>
<p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p>
<p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p>
<p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li>
<li>Are you ever going to post again?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p>
<p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p>
<p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p>
<p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p>
<h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration-2"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration-2" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p>
<p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p>
<p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-minimalism.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"
                ></p>
<p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p>
<p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"
                ></p>
<p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p>
<p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p>
<p><strong>Funky</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"
                ></p>
<p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Comic</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p>
<p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone. It’s bold and communicates confidence. If your attitude towards YouTube is that you want to be fearless, why not go for something worthy of a superhuman?</p>

<p><em>The following is a complete guide to YouTube banners, including instructions, tips, and free resources.</em></p>
<p>Channel art isn’t hard. Making video viewers enjoy enough that they click on your channel page - that’s hard. Channel art is just about reinforcing the positive feelings viewers have come away from your videos. Anyone who’s looking at your channel art is already thinking about subscribing to you. Your banner should make viewers feel happy with the choice they’ve already half-made.</p>

<h2 id="YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics-3"><a href="#YouTube-Banner-Size-and-Other-Basics-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics"></a><strong>YouTube Banner Size and Other Basics</strong></h2><p>YouTube channel art should be 2560 x 1440px.</p>
<p>As long as you upload an image or background that is that size, viewers looking at your channel on any device will be able to see that you’ve taken the time to personalize your channel page.</p>
<p>If you want to make a bit more of an impression, you can start thinking about banner dimensions. Depending on what type of screen (laptop, mobile, television) a viewer is visiting your channel on, they will see a different crop of that 2560 x 1440px channel art. That cropped image is your banner.</p>
<p>Television will display the entire image, but it is significantly smaller on other devices.</p>
<p>Desktop or laptop computers can show a view as large as 2560 x 423px, or as small as 1546 x 423px.</p>
<p>Tablets show an area that’s 1855 x 423px.</p>
<p>Mobile phones show an area that’s 1546 x 423px. This size is also the smallest possible desktop&#x2F;laptop view, and it is considered the ‘safe area.’ Any important text or graphics in your banner should fit within this section, or they could be awkwardly cut off in some views.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual guide to channel art dimensions:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/channel-art-cheat-sheet.jpg"
                      alt="channel-art-cheat-sheet"
                ></p>
<p>Another important detail to consider is the size of your file. YouTube will allow your channel art to have a file size of up to 6MB, but no larger.</p>
<h2 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources-3"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-and-Other-Resources-3" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates and Other Resources</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of free resources online, which can make the process of designing your channel art simple, including <a href="#templates">templates</a>, <a href="#photos">stock images</a>, <a href="#patterns">backgrounds</a>, and <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-3"><a href="#Free-YouTube-Banner-Templates-3" class="headerlink" title="Free YouTube Banner Templates"></a><strong>Free YouTube Banner Templates</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to get great channel art might be to find something pre-built you can personalize. There are a few places online you can find something free that will suit both your style and the types of videos you make:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>filmora.wondershare.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Here on filmora.io, we have a selection of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >50 free channel art templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download. The banners are divided into 10 categories representing both different types of YouTube channels (i.e., gaming and beauty) and different popular styles (i.e., minimalist and galaxy), so there’s something for everybody. When you download the free templates, you can choose between PSD files, so you can customize your banner in Photoshop and PNG files you can use with a free online program like Canva (or even Paint on your computer).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/"><strong>Visme</strong></a></p>
<p>On Visme, you’ll find another 50 free YouTube banners with themes like ‘Rock Star,’ ‘Makeup Tutorial,’ and ‘Cooking Lessons.’ The banners all make use of beautiful high-quality photographs (no patterned backgrounds). You can add your own channel name right on Visme and customize your font&#x2F;color.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://yourtubetheme.com/channel-art/"><strong>YourTube</strong></a></p>
<p>There is a massive amount of resources available on YourTube, which you can download for free. The category labeled templates only has 14 options, but there are really hundreds of options for YouTube channel art. ‘Templates’ just means downloads, which include PSD files where you can edit text. Under ‘All YouTube Channel Art,’ there are over 500 options. Some are patterned backgrounds, some are pictures, but all of them were designed to be channel art. It’s easy to look and imagine where your channel’s name will go.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of <a href="#makers">Channel Art Makers</a>, which include templates!</p>
<h4 id="Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts-3"><a href="#Free-Stock-Images-Backgrounds-and-Fonts-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts"></a><strong>Free Stock Images, Backgrounds, and Fonts</strong></h4><p>Sometimes all you need to do is add some text to a really great photo or background pattern. You can find awesome-looking and free options for all three of these things and piece together your own unique channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Free Stock Photos for YouTube Channel Art</strong></p>
<p>Unlike templates, stock photos will not already be the exact right size for uploading to YouTube. You’ll have to adjust them, but you don’t need expensive software to do this. You can use a banner maker, or just do some trimming in Paint. While you are making adjustments, <a href="#basics">keep the dimensions</a> from the first part of this article in mind, so important details aren’t partially cut off on some devices.</p>
<p>There are a lot of beautiful photographs available online, and sites like Stocksy are great if you have the budget available to purchase images. If you need free options, then there are lots of those too, but you do sometimes need to be careful that the way you want to use an image is allowed within the license provided by the site or photographer.</p>
<p>We recommend these two sites for anybody who finds copyright rules confusing because both of these sites allow you to use their photos for free, for any purpose (commercial or personal), without attribution (although they do appreciate attribution).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-unsplash.jpg"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-unsplash"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unsplash.com/"><strong>Unsplash:</strong></a> This site has a huge selection, and more photos are being added all the time. Finding what you want is as easy as typing a keyword (i.e., ‘sunset’) into the search bar on the home page.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-pexels.jpg"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-pexels"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/"><strong>Pexels:</strong></a> you can find a wide variety of images on Pexels just by using the search bar on the main page, much like Unsplash. There is actually some overlap in the images available on the two sites, but they also each have photos the other doesn’t, so it’s worth looking at both.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners-3"><a href="#Free-Background-Patterns-for-YouTube-Banners-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners"></a><strong>Free Background Patterns for YouTube Banners</strong></h4><p>Photographs just don’t suit every type of channel. If you don’t think photos of scenery match the style of your channel, you might want to consider a background pattern. Because patterns repeat, you don’t need to worry much about things being cut off when you upload a pattern as channel art (although you’ll still need to make sure any text you add is in the <a href="#basics">safe area</a>).</p>
<p>One thing you should watch for when using a background pattern is that text can sometimes be hard to read if it’s sitting on top of a busy pattern. You might want to put a box of solid color between your channel name and the pattern.</p>
<p>The patterns on the following two sites are free to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library.png"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-the-pattern-library"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/"><strong>The Pattern Library:</strong></a> this truly is a library, and all the patterns were submitted by real graphic designers. When you first arrive on the site, all you’ll see is a randomly selected pattern filling your entire screen. Hovering over the designer’s name in the top left will allow you to download it for free.</p>
<p>Often, the download will not be as large as the image you see on the site. It will only be a few tiles (or just one tile), and you will need to copy&#x2F;paste it a few times to create a background large enough to use as channel art.</p>
<p>You can use the navigation tools in the top right of the screen to see more patterns. Clicking the icon that looks like a bunch of squares will allow you to see multiple patterns at once.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern.jpg"
                      alt="free-youtube-banner-hero-pattern"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.heropatterns.com/"><strong>Hero Patterns:</strong></a> the patterns on this site are editable before you download. You choose a foreground color, a background color, and the opacity of the design in the foreground. This means that you can make the pattern as subtle or vibrant as you want, which is a great thing to have control over when you’re creating channel art.</p>
<p>When you choose your custom colors and opacity, every pattern preview on the page will update. You can put in the colors you like for your channel first, and then find a pattern that looks good with them.</p>
<p>The only downside to Hero Patterns is that downloading your pattern is hard. You actually can’t just download it. Instead, the site generates a code you can embed on a website.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a website, the easiest thing is probably to use the Snipping Tool (included on all PCs since Vista) to save the preview and then just copy&#x2F;paste it as a tile in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p>
<h4 id="Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art-3"><a href="#Free-Fonts-for-YouTube-Channel-Art-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Free Fonts for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>Whatever program you use to build your channel art will already have a selection of fonts. Finding the perfect font to use across your channel art, thumbnails, and for any text, you include in your videos isn’t something you need to think about until your channel is large enough that you’re thinking about your ‘brand’. If you feel like you’re at that stage, or want to get a jump start on it, here are a couple of sites where you can find free fonts and install them on your computer.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dafont.com/"><strong>DaFont:</strong></a> there are categories on this site like fancy, gothic, and script, and there are even sub-categories like sci-fi and calligraphy. Licensing limits (whether the font is free and whether it is available for commercial use) will be clearly displayed next to every font. When browsing, you can even type your channel name in where it says ‘Preview’ and see what it will look like in all the different fonts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/"><strong>Font Squirrel:</strong></a> the nice thing about this site is that everything is guaranteed to be free and available for commercial use. If you scroll down a bit on the main page, you’ll see a toolbar to the right of the screen, which will allow you to narrow down the fonts being displayed by selecting tags like grunge, headings, and casual.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got an image or images, and maybe even a font you want to use in your banner, you can create your channel art in either a software like Photoshop or a free banner maker (anchor) like the ones below.</p>
<h2 id="Free-Channel-Art-Makers-3"><a href="#Free-Channel-Art-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="Free Channel Art Makers"></a><strong>Free Channel Art Makers</strong></h2><p>You don’t need an expensive program like Adobe Photoshop to make great channel art. There is a lot of photo editing and graphic design programs available for free online, and most of them are a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>All three of these sites will allow you to build your banner just by dragging images and text to where you want them, and they even provide premade templates (although those might not be free in some cases).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></p>
<p>Canva is probably the most popular site for creating YouTube banners for free, for a good reason. It’s extremely intuitive for beginners who are making their first graphics, and it’s also a capable enough program to satisfy more intermediate-level users. Canva has stock images, banner templates, and other graphics available, but some of them cost $1 to use. You can also upload your own media instead of relying on Canva’s resources.</p>
<p>To build channel art in Canva, find ‘YouTube Channel Art’ as one of the options, and you’ll be working with a canvas that’s already the right size. You can also choose from a lot of different layout options, which will divide your canvas into different drop zones for images (pictures will be auto-sized to fit the zone).</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Canva is the huge library of stock images, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that you can’t have multiple images stretched to the end of your canvas.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/"><strong>Wondershare PixStudio:</strong></a></p>
<p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of PixStudio is that it provides a feature to remove the image background, you can use the image more flexibility. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the features will be used after payment of $7.99 per month.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ultimate-guide-to-effective-youtube-banners.jpg"
                      alt=" Wondershare PixStudio Banner Maker"
                ></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.designwizard.com/"><strong>Design Wizard</strong></a></p>
<p>This is another easy to use image editor with templates and stock images, like Canva. You just select YouTube Cover from the options in the Social Media menu (there are also options for YouTube Thumbnails and Profile Pics).</p>
<p>In Canva, images you drag into your layout will automatically shift to fit the area you put them into. This doesn’t happen in Design Wizard, which can either slow down or speed up your process, depending on which you prefer.</p>
<p>One major <strong>benefit</strong> of Design Wizard is that it provides you with a ‘safe zone box’ so you can see the smallest view of your channel art while you work. One <strong>drawback</strong> is that the photos in Design Wizard aren’t free, so you’ll either have to buy them or use your own.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> the safe zone box costs $1, so the price of your download will always look like $1 until you delete it when you’re finished designing. Then your price will drop to $0 if you haven’t used any other paid elements.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fotor.com/"><strong>Fotor</strong></a></p>
<p>Fotor works similarly to the other two programs on this list. Just look for ‘YouTube Channel Art’ in the Header &amp; Cover section and click on it to start designing. It does not have layouts like Canva, but it is also a drag-and-drop program, and it is better than Canva if you like to edit with layers.</p>
<p>Fotor has more free templates than Canva or Design Wizard, although it does also have some premium options. Creating a paid account will allow you to access premium resources and get rid of ads (costs $39.99 for the year), but if all you want it for is to create channel art, a paid account probably isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>You can upload your own images to use in Fotor as well.</p>
<p>A major <strong>benefit</strong> of Fotor is that it has a lot of genuinely free channel art templates you can customize, and one <strong>drawback</strong> is that it doesn’t have as many stock photos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-Good-Channel-Art-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Good Channel Art"></a><strong>How to Make Good Channel Art</strong></h2><p>Finding an image, cutting it to the right size, and uploading it to YouTube is easy, but how many of your favorite YouTubers use just an image for their channel art? Usually, there’s at least a little text stating the name of the channel.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll give you a quick checklist of things to include in your banner (anchor), and some tips on making excellent channel art.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Art-Checklist-3"><a href="#Channel-Art-Checklist-3" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Checklist"></a><strong>Channel Art Checklist</strong></h4><p>Here are some things you might want to include in your YouTube banner. Not all of these are right for every type of channel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Channel name</li>
<li>What kinds of videos you make</li>
<li>Your posting schedule</li>
<li>Social media handles</li>

Here are our top 5 tips for making channel art that looks impressive and supports the growth of your channel.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#solidbackground">Solid Background Behind Text</a></li>
<li><a href="#minimaltext">Keep Text to a Minimum</a></li>
<li><a href="#imagesandcolors">Use Images and Colors That Suit Your Channel</a></li>
<li><a href="#face">Include Your Face</a></li>
<li><a href="#reason">Give Viewers a Reason To Subscribe</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solid Background Behind Text</strong></p>
<p>When viewers look at your channel page, you want your name and any other information your banner conveys to jump out at them. It is hard for text to jump out at anybody when it’s competing with a busy background, especially if some of the colors in the background are similar to the color of the text.</p>
<p>If possible, you can place your text on the part of your background pattern or image where there isn’t much happening behind it. When that isn’t possible, it doesn’t mean you need to find a new background. Instead, insert a solid-colored shape between the text and your background image. Your text will look great, and you won’t have to compromise on a background you like.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Text to a Minimum</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot you might want to say in your banner. You’ll want to tell viewers the name of the channel, what kinds of videos you make, when you upload those different kinds of videos, and maybe even the general philosophy driving your channel (i.e., ‘to spread positivity’). That’s all great, but try to say it fast.</p>
<p>Realistically, viewers probably won’t read more than one line of text. Writing more than that could also force you to use smaller text that viewers will have trouble reading. Ideally, a viewer should absorb all the information in your banner at a glance without having to make the decision to read it.</p>
<p>Keep your text to your channel name and one additional line underneath, if you can. Make sure your additional line of text is smaller than your channel name, so they aren’t competing.</p>
<p><strong>Use Images and Colors that Suit Your Channel</strong></p>
<p>If you have an upbeat, positive, channel then a black and red banner with skulls on it might not be the best choice to convey that. Similarly, if you have a gaming channel, then a minimalist banner that includes an Instagram-worthy picture of you wearing the latest seasonal styles might send the wrong message. It will make the viewer that sees it think you have a lifestyle channel, and they may click away thinking the Let’s Play they just watched was a one-off.</p>
<p>Look at the kinds of colors and images other YouTubers in your niche are using for inspiration for what you should do, but also consider the unique message of your channel. If you consider yourself bold, use bolder colors. If your videos have a more relaxed vibe, something softer might make sense.</p>
<p>Here’s a guide to what people tend to associate with different colors:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-implication.jpg"
                      alt="color-implication"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Include Your Face</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t essential for every type of channel. If you mostly post gaming content or screencast tutorials and you don’t appear much in your actual videos, there’s no need to appear in your banner.</p>
<p>However, if your channel is primarily about you as a personality, then including your face in your channel art can have a lot of benefits. People are automatically drawn in by eye contact and feel more connected when they can see a face. Besides just looking good, including your face in your banner can help build a relationship with new viewers and make them feel more comfortable subscribing. They’ll know they’re subscribing to a person, not just a channel.</p>
<p><strong>Give Viewers a Reason to Subscribe</strong></p>
<p>Someone who has chosen to check out your channel page is already thinking about subscribing, but they didn’t do it from the video page because they want to know a bit more about you. The things they are probably hoping to find out are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have more videos like that one they just watched? Will you make more?</li>
<li>Are you ever going to post again?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of YouTubers that just give up at some point, or who have started a channel but don’t have time to post very often. That you might never post a new video again, or might not post one for so long that the new subscriber forgets who you are, is a real hesitation viewer can have about subscribing.</p>
<p>Viewers also want to know that when you do post again, the video you post will be something they like. If they liked the video, they found you through because it was funny, but there’s nothing on your channel page that suggests you do comedy videos regularly, then that can make someone think twice. If you subscribe because of a makeup tutorial, but then the creator only posts personal vlogs from then on, it can be disappointing.</p>
<p>By clearly stating what kinds of videos you make and when you post them in your banner, you are giving viewers a reason to subscribe.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>“Vlogs &amp; Comedy! New videos every Tuesday.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Two videos every week! Makeup Mondays and Fashion Fridays”</em></p>
<p>If you can create channel art that has a layout that makes sense and sends a clear message even at a glance, then that will help you look like a more experienced YouTuber.</p>
<h2 id="Channel-Art-Inspiration-3"><a href="#Channel-Art-Inspiration-3" class="headerlink" title="Channel Art Inspiration"></a><strong>Channel Art Inspiration</strong></h2><p>Sometimes your niche on YouTube will determine what kinds of channel art you should use. For example, it makes sense for gamers to include game-related graphics in their banners and for travel vloggers to use photos from the destinations they’ve visited.</p>
<p>However, for lots of YouTube niches, the channel art you make will be built around your personality. How do you know what fits your personality? Here’s some inspiration based on popular trends.</p>
<p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p>

                      alt="text-and-logo-minimalism"
                ></p>
<p>This is an example of a minimalist YouTube banner. This style typically uses only 2 or 3 colors and features clean lines, simple backgrounds, and not a lot of noise. If you want to project a calm, tidy, balanced vibe on your channel, then you should consider going in a minimalist direction with your banner.</p>
<p>This example is light and airy, but you can also create a minimalist look using brighter or darker colors. It just depends on your personality.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Themed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-galaxy-themed.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-galaxy-themed"
                ></p>
<p>Galaxy banners are exactly what they sound like: channel art featuring space scenes or photographs of the night sky. At first glance, you might think they belong with channels that talk about science or sci-fi, and they are great for that, but they’re also a fun choice for comedy, vlogging, or gaming.</p>
<p>The great thing about the galaxy style is that it’s cool and different, but it doesn’t take over and distract from your message. There is a lot of room for a space scene to be very personalized. The example above is bold and purple. You can find galaxy photos in just about any color, and they can be either bright like this one or quite dark.</p>
<p><strong>Funky</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-Funky.jpg"
                      alt="text-and-logo-Funky"
                ></p>
<p>There isn’t really one ‘funky’ style. A funky banner is anything that’s just a little off-beat but still makes sense while you’re looking at it. They tend to be bright and cheerful and are perfect for anyone who considers themselves a bit quirky.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for inspiration for a custom funky banner, go to your closet and find your favorite funny, cute, or ironic t-shirt. There’s probably something in its design you can bring into your channel art.</p>
<p><strong>Comic</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/text-and-logo-comic.jpg" alt="/text-and-logo-comic"></p>
<p>A banner featuring an actual comic book character probably belongs to a channel that discusses comics, but the style itself is great for just about anyone. It’s bold and communicates confidence. If your attitude towards YouTube is that you want to be fearless, why not go for something worthy of a superhuman?</p>
<p>Do you have any of your own tips to share about YouTube banners?</p>
