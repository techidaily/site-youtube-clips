So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.</p><p>For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.</p><p>This may take a lot of time.

So, give Filmora a try and become surprised by how easy it is to create a high-quality YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-aural-archive-discussion-and-judgment/"><u>[New] Aural Archive Discussion & Judgment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-comprehenensive-guide-to-youtube-studios-editing-features/"><u>2024 Approved A Comprehenensive Guide to YouTube Studio's Editing Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/charting-creators-fortune-revenue-generated-from-youtube-advertisements-for-2024/"><u>Charting Creator's Fortune Revenue Generated From Youtube Advertisements for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/elevate-video-consumption-constructing-an-ideal-watch-later-list-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Video Consumption Constructing an Ideal 'Watch Later' List on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/fix-unrecognized-external-drives-on-windows-10-a-comprehensive-walkthrough/"><u>Fix: Unrecognized External Drives on Windows 10 – A Comprehensive Walkthrough</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/from-concept-to-reality-googles-latest-leap-palm-2/"><u>From Concept to Reality: Google's Latest Leap, PaLM 2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/from-grayscale-to-glamour-professional-color-adjustment-for-2024/"><u>From Grayscale to Glamour Professional Color Adjustment for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/fully-unlock-your-dominican-republic-iphone-a-step-by-step-permanent-solution/"><u>Fully Unlock Your Dominican Republic iPhone - A Step-by-Step Permanent Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/youtube-names-generators-plus-how-to-brainstorm/"><u>Good YouTube Names Generators [+ How to Brainstorm]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-for-realme-11x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Realme 11X 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/perfect-panning-leading-stabilizers-unveiled/"><u>Perfect Panning Leading Stabilizers Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/preparation-to-beat-giovani-in-pokemon-go-for-samsung-galaxy-a24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Samsung Galaxy A24 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Businesses use FameBit to find the perfect video creators – or ‘digital influencers’ – to help with their marketing campaigns.</p><p>Until your channel is huge it is difficult to make a significant amount of money through ad revenue on YouTube. Creating branded content is one way in which YouTubers with small or mid-sized channels can generate income.</p><p>Finding sponsorships and negotiating with brands can be tricky. So can integrating products and brand messages in your videos without making your audience feel like you have ‘sold out’. This guide will help.</p><p>You must have at least 5,000 subscribers to join FameBit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-famebit-find-youtube-sponsorship.jpg"                      alt="Use FameBit to Find YouTube Sponsorship"                ></p><h2 id="How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Can You Make"></a>How Much Money Can You Make</h2><p>How much money you can make on FameBit will depend on the deals you can negotiate with brands, and those deals will depend on how many subscribers you have and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how many views you usually receive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>When calculating your fee, FameBit suggests thinking of it in terms of ‘cost per view’ (CPV). Most creators on FameBit charge between $0.05 and $0.10 per view. If you charge $0.05 per view and you get an average of 10,000 views per video then you would charge a brand $500 for your services.</p><p>How much you should charge per view depends on your genre and the nature of your audience. If you often mention products you like in videos and your subscribers have come to trust your recommendations, then it makes sense for you to charge more per view than a creator whose audience will be less receptive to product placement.</p><p>For example, if you do makeup tutorials then viewers will be used to hearing about your favorites. This makes your 10 000 views more valuable than 10 000 views on a ranting vlog channel whose subscribers are not tuning in to hear about products.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money With FameBit"></a>How to Make Money With FameBit</h2><h4 id="Finding-Sponsorships"><a href="#Finding-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Finding Sponsorships"></a>Finding Sponsorships</h4><p>Brands post details about their upcoming campaigns, and the types of creators they are interested in working with, on FameBit.</p><p>While you are browsing through the available campaigns, think of the types of brands you would be excited to work with as well as which ones make sense for your channel.</p><p>If you host a lifestyle vlog about staying healthy, for example, and there is an opportunity to work with a brand that sells a type of healthy snack then it is your responsibility to look into the company and the product before you sign on to work with them. Is the snack healthy, and do you enjoy it?</p><p>Ideally, you will want to find brands that share your values and which are selling products you feel good about recommending to your subscribers.</p><p>Once you find a few campaigns you are interested in creating videos for, it’s time to write your proposals and negotiate with your potential sponsors.</p><h4 id="Negotiating-with-Sponsors"><a href="#Negotiating-with-Sponsors" class="headerlink" title="Negotiating with Sponsors"></a>Negotiating with Sponsors</h4><p>When you want to be part of a campaign a brand has posted, you send them a proposal.</p><p>Be creative and detailed in the proposals you write. The best brands will value you for our ideas and creativity, and this will give you an edge over creators who put less effort into their pitches. You also want to be detailed because you do not want to risk having a disagreement with the brand based on them misunderstanding what you were going to do.</p><p>Sometimes brands will have very specific things they want you to do or say in the video you make for them. It is your job to find ways of doing and saying these things that still feel natural within the context of your videos. On YouTube, even when you are representing a brand, you need to be authentically you.</p><p>If you feel like the things a brand wants from you will make your video come across as a tacky commercial and offend your loyal subscribers, and you cannot see a creative way around this, bring it up before you agree to work with them. Explain what you think should happen instead. If they are not willing to compromise, do not agree to work with them. Find a more reasonable brand to partner with.</p><p>If you offend your subscribers and they stop watching you then your channel will become less valuable to other potential sponsors. In the long run, there is no upside to agreeing to do a video that makes no sense for your channel.</p><p>Remember that even brands that like your ideas and get excited about your proposals will not be able to work with you if you do not meet their requirements in terms of subscribers and average views. There are a lot of campaigns on FameBit which are open to small or mid-sized channels, but there will always be minimum requirements. It makes no sense for a brand to pay you to make a video nobody will see, even if it is an amazing video. Sad, but true.</p><h4 id="How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience"></a>How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience</h4><p>Some of your subscribers will resent any branded content you create and there is no way around that. These subscribers will be in the minority – most people understand that accepting sponsorship from brands helps their favorite YouTubers continue making great videos – but it is unavoidable that there will be a few.</p><p>Most of your subscribers will not be bothered by the idea of you partnering with a brand, so long as you go about it in the right way.</p><p>Firstly; be honest about your sponsorship. Do not pretend to be giving an objective opinion on a product when the company who makes it is paying you. Your viewers will know and they will be offended.</p><p>Secondly; incorporate the brand’s message or product into your videos in ways that feel natural. Do not stray too far from your usual video style. Ultimately every video you make, even branded content, is for your viewers. Make the kind of video they expect from you and mention the product or service you have agreed to in a place where it makes sense&#x2F;is on topic.</p><p>You want the branding in your videos to be subtle, but you never want to hide that it is there.</p><p>So long as you are honest and the more commercial elements of your video are not distracting, the vast majority of your subscribers – the ones you have built a real relationship with – will not mind.</p><h2 id="Custom-Videos-with-Awesome-Video-Editor"><a href="#Custom-Videos-with-Awesome-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Custom

Loop is similar to traditional YouTube videos, but it can be played on a TV screen like a traditional TV show. Loop is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your content. It’s like a one-stop shop for all your content needs. You can use it to promote your latest video series.</p><p>Why <strong>looping YouTube videos on a TV</strong> is a great idea? First, it can be a fun way to watch your favorite videos without having to worry about the time. Second, it can be a way to save money on your cable. By watching your favorite videos on loop, you can cut down on the number of times you need to watch them.</p><p>If you are watching a series of videos, for example, looping them can help you to remember what happened in each one. Secondly, it can help you to learn new information more easily. If you are watching a tutorial or a video about a new topic, looping can help you to remember the details better.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                ></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Create-a-Loop-Video-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Create-a-Loop-Video-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Create a Loop Video for YouTube"></a>Part 1: How to Create a Loop Video for YouTube</h2><p>There is a lot of debate around whether or not creating a loop video is necessary for success on YouTube. Some people believe that it’s not necessary, while others believe that it is a must. The main benefit of creating a loop video is that it helps to keep your audience engaged. It also helps to create a sense of continuity between your videos.</p><p>Creating a loop video for your YouTube channel increases engagement because viewers can watch the video over and over again. This can lead to more clicks on your ads, which can lead to more revenue. It can also increase your subscribers and views. Maybe some people want to watch the same video multiple times in a row without having to keep pressing the play button on the remote.</p><p><strong>Filmora is the best video loop editor:</strong></p><p>If you need a powerful video editing tool that will let you create high-quality clips with multiple loops, look no further than <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The product should be related to a topic you know a lot about. This will make your review more credible. It is easier to grow your channel if you focus on a niche (i.e. camera equipment or makeup) you are particularly knowledgeable about.</p><ul><li><a href="#affiliatelinks">Affiliate Links</a></li><li><a href="#freeproducts">Getting Products for Free</a></li><li><a href="#filming">Filming the Video</a></li></ul><h3 id="Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links"><a href="#Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links"></a>Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links</h3><p>One of the main ways you can make money doing reviews is through affiliate links. When you join the affiliate program of an online store they will allow you to create special links, called affiliate links, to products listed there. You post these affiliate links in the descriptions of your video reviews and, if viewers choose to click on those links and buy the products, you will earn a sales commission. Here are some stores with great affiliate programs:</p><h4 id="1-JVZoo"><a href="#1-JVZoo" class="headerlink" title="1. JVZoo"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.jvzoo.com/" >JVZoo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>You can find high end products for about $5 to $10. Budgeting will be important if you plan on purchasing products to review instead of only reviewing products you already own (you should try to review items you already have as much as possible).</p><h4 id="2-Click-Bank"><a href="#2-Click-Bank" class="headerlink" title="2. Click Bank"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="http://www.clickbank.com/" >Click Bank <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>You can find a wide range of interesting products here, and you can earn as much as 75% on sales commissions if you provide your viewers with an affiliate link.</p><h4 id="3-Warrior-Plus"><a href="#3-Warrior-Plus" class="headerlink" title="3. Warrior Plus"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://warriorplus.com/" >Warrior Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a highly renowned affiliate program.

Until then, you can buy the products yourself or review products which you already own. It will be a lot cheaper to review things you already have, or which you were already planning to buy, than to buy products for the purpose of reviewing them. Your reviews will also be more detailed and useful when they are on products you are especially familiar with.</p><p>Once you start building a following, brands will come to you and it will be your choice whether you want to review the things they send you. Until then, try to promote&#x2F;review products you already have opinions on.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:  Filming the Video"></a>Part 3:  Filming the Video</h3><p>Be completely honest. People are going to know when you are trying to sell something. Fake reviewers are all over the place, and they are easily spotted.</p><p>That does not mean you shouldn’t make money through affiliate links, or accept free products to review.

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

If you don’t, potential viewers will miss out on the chance to discover and enjoy your videos.</p><p>Instead of forcing yourself through a painful brainstorming session, it can be easier to identify the best tags using these techniques that experienced content managers use to populate their tag lists.</p><p>In this article, I will show you how to find great tags for your YouTube videos as well as some answers to the frequently asked questions about YouTube Tags.</p><ol><li><a href="#auto">Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool</a></li><li><a href="#gen">Try YouTube Tag Generators</a></li><li><a href="#rival">Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Find-YouTube-Tags-3-Effective-Ways"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Find-YouTube-Tags-3-Effective-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Find YouTube Tags [3 Effective Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to Find YouTube Tags [3 Effective Ways]</h2><h3 id="1-Use-YouTube’s-Auto-Suggest-Tool-to-Get-Tags"><a href="#1-Use-YouTube’s-Auto-Suggest-Tool-to-Get-Tags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags"></a>1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags</h3><p>YouTube’s search engine can be your best ally on the quest for great tags. This tool was created to aid users who are looking for content on the platform, and content creators can benefit from it as well. By typing the general topic of your video, or a few words vaguely related to your video, into the search bar on YouTube you can see suggestions that reflect what viewers are searching for and take some of those suggestions into consideration for your tags. With every new phrase (and even every additional character you type), new options will appear. By playing around with this tool you will gain valuable insight into the searching habits of YouTube viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-tag-by-searching.jpg"                      alt=" Find YouTube Video Tag"                ></p><p>This method may not be too precise, but the idea is to quickly gather information and perhaps get some inspiration for more creative or complex tags. Most of the suggestions will be logical, but there can be a few unexpected combinations you’d never think of. Be very careful when translating the findings to your own situation, since the fact that some terms are popular doesn’t mean they are relevant for your video. Another problem is that slightly altered terminology can significantly change the effectiveness of the tag, so you should ideally use the suggested phrases in the exact form as you found them or not at all. If you do make adjustments, you should test the new tag through the same auto-complete tool and see how it fares.</p><h3 id="2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators"><a href="#2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators" class="headerlink" title="2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators"></a>2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators</h3><p>If you’d like to dig a little deeper, there are multiple dedicated tools that can assist you in picking the most suitable YouTube tags for every video you upload. Let’s examine a few of them in greater detail:</p><h4 id="1-Keyword-Tool"><a href="#1-Keyword-Tool" class="headerlink" title="#1. Keyword Tool"></a>#1. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keyword Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>A very simple and reliable web-based tag generator that provides you with 750 frequently searched keywords that would be suitable for your video. The keyword list is based on YouTube’s search tool in a way similar to what we described in the previous chapter. However, since the analysis is automated with the Keyword Tool, you can get a huge list in just a few seconds. This generator is especially useful when you are looking for long-tail keywords that attract niche audiences.</p><h4 id="2-Rapid-Tags"><a href="#2-Rapid-Tags" class="headerlink" title="#2. Rapid Tags"></a>#2. <a class="link"   href="https://rapidtags.io/" >Rapid Tags <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This tool is a bit more sophisticated and includes some analytic features on top of tag generating capacities, allowing you to manage your channel more effectively.

It can suggest suitable tags for your new video based on the main keyword you provide, speeding up your research considerably. It can also analyze the tags placed on an existing YouTube video, which is important for deducing how other authors working in the same category are optimizing their content.</p><h3 id="3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags"><a href="#3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags"></a>3. Study Your YouTube Rivals’ Tags</h3><p>YouTube content authors can learn a lot by analyzing their top competitors. No matter what your videos are about, there are probably countless other creators that want to attract the same audiences as you. Only a tiny percentage of them will manage to gain significant viewership, and those are the ones you should be researching in detail.</p><p>If you are able to locate the most successful videos with content similar to yours you are already halfway to your goal, but one obstacle still remains. You can’t even see your competitor’s tags them when you click on their videos on YouTube. This type of information is not displayed, but some specialized solutions are able to reveal it upon request. Here is one YouTube certified analytic tool capable of doing that:</p><h4 id="1-VidIQ"><a href="#1-VidIQ" class="headerlink" title="1. VidIQ"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Currently used to manage more than 30,000 YouTube channels, this powerful video marketing suite can also help with tag selection.

How Many Tags Should You Use on YouTube?"></a>2.

In most cases, 5-8 tags are appreciated for a YouTube video. It is recommended to add as many relevant tags as you can, such as brand-specific tags, YouTube auto-suggest tags, or tags created with some tag generator.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Tags-on-YouTube-Get-More-Views"><a href="#3-Do-Tags-on-YouTube-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Tags on YouTube Get More Views?"></a>3. Do Tags on YouTube Get More Views?</h4><p>The short answer is Yes. Since Google is encouraging people to use tags to help them understand your video content, then it can recommend the videos to relevant users accordingly.

Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.</p><p>If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it.

Here’s where you can make or download intros, plus some tips on making intros that support the growth of your channel.</p><ol><li><a href="#makers">4 Free Intro Makers</a></li><li><a href="#tips">5 Tips for Making Great Intros</a></li></ol><h2 id="Free-Intro-Makers"><a href="#Free-Intro-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Free Intro Makers"></a>Free Intro Makers</h2><p>Here’s a list of 4 places you can create or download FREE YouTube intros with no watermark.</p><h4 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Blender is a free, open-source, ‘3D creation suite’. It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.</p><p>This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.</p><p>What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and <a href="#velosofy">Velosofy</a>.</p><h4 id="Movietools"><a href="#Movietools" class="headerlink" title="Movietools"></a><a class="link"   href="http://www.movietools.info/" >Movietools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.</p><p>You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and&#x2F;or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.</p><p>Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.</p><h4 id="Panzoid"><a href="#Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="Panzoid"></a><a class="link"   href="https://panzoid.com/" >Panzoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.</p><p>A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.</p><p>Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.</p><p>In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.</p><p>The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word&#x2F;line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.</p><p>Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.</p><h4 id="Velosofy"><a href="#Velosofy" class="headerlink" title="Velosofy"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.velosofy.com/" >Velosofy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.</p><p>Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is <a href="#blender">Blender</a>, the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.</p><h2 id="5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Making a Great Intro"></a>5 Tips for Making a Great Intro</h2><p>Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.</p><h4 id="1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds"><a href="#1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it Under 10 Seconds"></a>1. Keep it Under 10 Seconds</h4><p>Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.</p><p>Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.</p><h4 id="2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding"><a href="#2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding" class="headerlink" title="2. Match Your Channel’s Branding"></a>2. Match Your Channel’s Branding</h4><p>Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.</p><p>Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Music"><a href="#3-Use-Music" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Music"></a>3. Use Music</h4><p>Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.</p><h4 id="4-Include-Your-Channel-Name"><a href="#4-Include-Your-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="4. Include Your Channel Name"></a>4. Include Your Channel Name</h4><p>This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.</p><h4 id="5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro"><a href="#5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro"></a>5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro</h4><p>Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.</p><p> What’s your YouTube intro like?

There should be a minimum time gap between your video shoot, editing, and uploading it to your channel. Wondershare Filmora Video Editor can help you get your videos edited faster. Not only the interface is simple and intuitive, it has both the basic and professional editing tools such as cutting, trimming, crop&amp;zoom, a large collection of video effects and royalty-free music, and you can also upload the video directly on YouTube after editing.

If a viewer watches more than 30 seconds of the ad or clicks it, then the YouTuber will make money.</p><p>This is a general estimate of how much a YouTuber can make from ads once they qualify:</p><p>- 68% of advertisers ad spend goes to the video creator. If advertisers spend $100, creators get $68.</p><p>- $0.18 is the average rate per ad view.</p><p>- 1000 ad views will equal approximately $18</p><p>- 1000 video views will equal between $2-$5</p><h2 id="Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads"><a href="#Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads"></a><strong>Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads</strong></h2><p>For new YouTubers, it is getting harder and harder to get to that point where their sole income can be from YouTube ads.

YouTubers need to create good content consistently. In order to earn $100 for the initial payout, they need an average of 50,000 views. That’s just $100! A lot of views and not a big payout. Hardly enough to quit your day job.</p><p>That is why it is essential to have alternative ways to make money on YouTube, and not rely on the ads shown on your videos.

Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134498/18498" target="_top" id="2134498">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134498" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134498/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well. Have a clear call to action somewhere on your website. This is where your viewers become customers.</p><h4 id="But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet"><a href="#But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet" class="headerlink" title="But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?"></a><strong>But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?</strong></h4><p>While some YouTubers certainly start with their product and service in mind and find their customers to sell through YouTube, many others go the opposite way and discover their audience first.</p><p>Lilly Singh did not start a YouTube channel to sell her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/How-Be-Bawse-Guide-Conquering/dp/0385689306"><em>How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life</em></a>. Her YouTube channel gave her an audience and proved to publishers that there was enough demand for her to write a book that people will read.</p><p> As you <a class="link"   href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/get-more-youtube-subscribers-increase-video-views/" >grow your audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will find that there will be a demand for certain products or services that don’t already exist. This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers. Remi created a beauty brand and DIY face mask, <a class="link"   href="https://shophoneypop.com/" >Honey Pop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which could only have happened after taking the time to understand her supportive audience.</p><h2 id="2-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#2-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="2. Affiliate Marketing:"></a><strong>2. Affiliate Marketing:</strong></h2><p>Businesses know that there are more eyes watching YouTube than ever — behind Google, YouTube is the second most popular place for people researching what to buy — and influencers and reviews are an effective method of getting sales. You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a><em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust. You wouldn’t buy a computer from a nutritionist and you wouldn’t buy vitamins from a gamer, so consider what you are an expert in and what products you have the most authority to speak about.</p><h4 id="What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?"></a><strong>What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h4><p>There are no restrictions on what will make a good affiliate marketing video, but there are best practices.</p><p>What’s important is understanding the purpose of the video. If the video is about vlogging microphones, then it makes complete sense to have an affiliate link to your favorite microphone. Odds are the people who are watching the video may be considering buying a new microphone, so the link is helpful for them.</p><p>Here are a few types of videos that make for good affiliate marketing opportunities:</p><p>- Product reviews</p><p>- Top 10</p><p>- How-tos</p><p>- Cheap vs expensive</p><p>- What to pack for…</p><p> <strong>How to Get an Affiliate Marketing Link for YouTube?</strong></p><p>Which affiliate marketing program you choose to sign up with will depend on the products you want to link to through your content. Do some research on what each network has to offer in regards to your niche.</p><p>Here is the list of 4 popular affiliate marketing networks:</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" >Amazon Associates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://rakutenmarketing.com/affiliate" >Rakuten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.shareasale.com/" >ShareASale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://peerfly.com/" >PeerFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can also partner with brands directly as many of them, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.sephora.com/affiliates" >Sephora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/affiliate-program" >Canon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, will have their own affiliate program.</p><h2 id="3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships"><a href="#3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:"></a><strong>3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:</strong></h2><p>Selling out, that is often the thought when we hear creators getting brand deals and sponsorships, but that stigma is unfounded if the brand and the content are properly aligned. As your channel grows, you will begin to recognize brands that match your values — and the values of your viewers — and those that don’t.</p><p>Today, more and more brands are collaborating with YouTube creators, because <a class="link"   href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/youtube-influencer-marketing-rulebook/" >creators are 4x more effective in earning brand familiarity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than collaborations with traditional celebrities.</p><p>In an ad for Beats by Dre’s #BuiltForBosses campaign, YouTuber <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-self-made-star-shows-one-way-to-crack-the-gen-z-code-1511719567?mod=e2tw" >Liza Koshy outperformed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the likes of Tom Brady and DJ Khaled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perform-the-likes9.jpg"                      alt="perform the likes"                ></p><p>While it does take significant effort on YouTube to acquire a following, it is possible for a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers to get a brand deal. Getting the buy-in from brands is a numbers game, and according to <a class="link"   href="https://videocreators.com/how-to-get-started-with-brand-deals-on-youtube/" >Video Creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the minimal number of views per video shouldn’t be lower than 2,000 if this is the path you want to head in.</p><h4 id="How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands"><a href="#How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Discovered By Brands"></a><strong>How to Get Discovered By Brands</strong></h4><p>The decision-makers behind brands might not be aware of influencers with a smaller following — those who have just cracked the 5,000 subscriber mark. The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results.

Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5?

Let your audience know exactly what you are planning to spend the funds on and how it will benefit them. One way to really encourage them is to have a goal, for example, a trip to a conference, and a special video will be produced to highlight the event.</p><h4 id="Set-a-Target"><a href="#Set-a-Target" class="headerlink" title="Set a $ Target"></a><strong>Set a $ Target</strong></h4><p>If you have a pie in the sky goal, you aren’t going to fully leverage the message to your audience.

This might be needed if you have uploaded content quite some time ago and it is already outdated. Or, if you have too many videos on your channel and you need to clear up those who aren’t that interesting.</p><p> The fact of the matter is that it’s quite easy to remove YouTube videos. The first thing that you would need to do is going ahead and hop on the website and log into your account. Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.</p><p> Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you’ve uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg"                      alt="Video list"                ></p><p> There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don’t want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="remove youtube videos"                ></p><p> That’s pretty much it – there’s nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels"></a>Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels</h2><p> Now that we’ve covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it’s time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don’t want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it’s going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that’s the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.</p><p> You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it’s invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it’s easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="remove other&#39;s youtube videos"                ></p><p> The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do. It’s going to ensure that your channel is perfectly updated, aligned and structured while at the same time making sure that everything is in line with your privacy. YouTube is a powerful website, and you need to be able to stay in control in order to be protected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-simplified-approach-to-preserving-video-calls/"><u>[New] Simplified Approach to Preserving Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-try-this-groundbreaking-free-valorant-audio-swap-tech-for-2024/"><u>[New] Try This Groundbreaking, Free Valorant Audio Swap Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-effortless-way-to-personalize-your-youtube-channel-url/"><u>[Updated] Effortless Way to Personalize Your YouTube Channel Url</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-visibility-comprehensive-guide-to-video-marketing-titles/"><u>2024 Approved Elevate Visibility Comprehensive Guide to Video Marketing Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/beauty-vlogs-from-basics-to-brilliance-launching-a-youtube-channel/"><u>Beauty Vlogs From Basics to Brilliance Launching a YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Samsung Galaxy A15 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/earn-on-youtube-beginners-path-to-profitability-for-2024/"><u>Earn on YouTube Beginner's Path to Profitability for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/experience-the-future-of-vacuuming-with-yeedis-newly-released-m12-proplus-robovac-in-the-us-market/"><u>Experience the Future of Vacuuming with Yeedi's Newly Released M12 Pro+ Robovac in the US Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/exploring-the-best-text-to-speech-online-tools-to-use-for-2024/"><u>Exploring The Best Text-to-Speech Online Tools To Use for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-boosting-your-youtube-shorts-profits-key-requirements-and-earning-potential/"><u>In 2024, Boosting Your Youtube Shorts Profits Key Requirements & Earning Potential</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-building-a-sustainable-income-via-youtube-and-adsense/"><u>In 2024, Building a Sustainable Income via YouTube and AdSense</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/increase-viewership-swiftly-5-strategy-unveiled/"><u>Increase Viewership Swiftly - $5 Strategy Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/the-complete-walkthrough-of-incorporating-emoticons-in-messages-and-apps-on-the-iphone/"><u>The Complete Walkthrough of Incorporating Emoticons in Messages and Apps on the iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-live-recording-best-15-video-resources/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Live Recording - Best 15 Video Resources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/week-in-review-atandt-hack-exposed-samsung-unveils-latest-mobile-tech/"><u>Week in Review: AT&T Hack Exposed, Samsung Unveils Latest Mobile Tech</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.</p><p>Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg"                      alt="youtube platform"                ></p><p>Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos</h2><p>YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube aspect ratio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar’s white or grey&#x2F;black area along the edges.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop&#x2F;PC Version:</p><p>If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:</p><p>There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version</p><p>Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg"                      alt="vertical video example"                ></p><p>Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio</h2><p>The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube shorts ratio"                ></p><p>Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.</p><p>Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads"><a href="#Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads"></a>Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads</h2><p>If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income.

So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube aspect ratio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar’s white or grey&#x2F;black area along the edges.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop&#x2F;PC Version:</p><p>If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:</p><p>There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version</p><p>Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg"                      alt="vertical video example"                ></p><p>Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio-3"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio</h2><p>The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible.

Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube shorts ratio"                ></p><p>Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format.
