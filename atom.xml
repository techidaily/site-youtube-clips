The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-writer-free-word-processor-1x.3d9c80d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

While some of the creative tools might be expensive, the easy ones have a steep learning curve, and engaging a professional designer wouldn’t be something you might be ready for. <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is a great solution for any such situation.</p><p>With that being said, the following sections talk about what <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is, how is it useful, what advantages does it offer, and how can you create professional video adverts using the tool.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Get YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Tips for Making Good Video Ads with YouTube Video Builder</a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>YouTube recently came up with an online tool, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.</p><ul><li><strong>HD Images</strong></li></ul><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Chrome Browser</strong></li></ul><p>You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></li></ul><p>Because <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Channel created <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability of the Tool and Features</strong></li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</h2><p>As explained earlier, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.</p><p>There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.</p><p>Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from. You can send your requests to: <a class="link"   href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/" >https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Once your request is approved, you can then use the same Google account to sign in to the <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> portal, and start preparing your video advertisements.

These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.</p><ul><li><strong>HD Images</strong></li></ul><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Chrome Browser</strong></li></ul><p>You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></li></ul><p>Because <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Channel created <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability of the Tool and Features</strong></li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer.

The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.</p><p>There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.</p><p>Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from.

These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.</p><ul><li><strong>HD Images</strong></li></ul><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Chrome Browser</strong></li></ul><p>You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></li></ul><p>Because <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Channel created <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability of the Tool and Features</strong></li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer.

These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark.

Dailymotion"></a>1. Dailymotion</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-dailymotion.JPG"                      alt="YouTune Alternatives - Dailymotion"                ></p><p>This may be the second most popular free video sharing website, and it is very similar to YouTube in appearance. Like YouTube, Dailymotion recommends videos to users based on what is trending as well as their personal viewing habits. Also like YouTube, there are ads in and around videos and you have the option of monetizing your content to earn ad revenue. There is more than one way to become a Dailymotion partner, though. You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.</p><p>The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here. However, you should be aware that the expectations of viewers might be higher.</p><h4 id="2-Vimeo"><a href="#2-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="2. Vimeo"></a>2. Vimeo</h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternative-vimeo.JPG"                      alt="YouTube Alternatives - Vimeo"                ></p><p>Although Vimeo is also a very popular video site, it is very different from YouTube. Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.</p><p>There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.</p><p>If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.</p><p>Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube. You can make videos watchable by everyone, just certain people, or require a password.</p><h4 id="3-ZippCast"><a href="#3-ZippCast" class="headerlink" title="3. ZippCast"></a>3.

While the expectations for video quality may be slightly higher on DailyMotion than YouTube, and are much higher on Vimeo, they are basically the same on ZippCast. Comedy, gaming, music, animation, and vlogging are the most popular categories and almost all content is posted by average people with average skill levels. One of the ways in which ZippCast is like the ‘old’ YouTube is that you can customize the design of your channel.</p><p>One of the things users appreciate most about ZippCast is that identifying and removing copyrighted videos is done by humans rather than an automated system, like on YouTube. This means that if you use copyrighted content that is licensed to you or protected by fair use your video should not be taken down. It is common for YouTubers to have their videos unfairly removed, although disputing the copyright claim will usually result in getting the video restored.</p><p>Although it is definitely large enough to be considered an alternative to YouTube, ZippCast has been unreliable in the past (i.e shutting down randomly) and has lost the trust of many users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>YouTube is a great platform where almost everyone goes to watches videos.

You had to accumulate over 1,000 subscribers and over 4,000 public watch hours. This can be difficult to attain, especially on a platform where creators are publishing new content every day. However, the 2023 update on the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) provided an easier way to start making money on YouTube.

This allows you to create unique cinematic effects that keep the audience wanting more of the content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>The introduction of the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ policy update was a special moment for small YouTubers. It meant that the platform was extending its YPP program to more creators, allowing them to earn money from their content. Lowering the monetization requirement gives more people a chance to make money faster. However, it is important to make sure that your videos are offering value to your audience. We recommend using Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos and make sure they stand out from the competition. The better your videos will be, the more views you will get, and the more money you will make.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.</p><p>This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.</p><p>What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and <a href="#velosofy">Velosofy</a>.</p><h4 id="Movietools"><a href="#Movietools" class="headerlink" title="Movietools"></a><a class="link"   href="http://www.movietools.info/" >Movietools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.</p><p>You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and&#x2F;or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.</p><p>Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.</p><h4 id="Panzoid"><a href="#Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="Panzoid"></a><a class="link"   href="https://panzoid.com/" >Panzoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.</p><p>A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.</p><p>Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.</p><p>In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.</p><p>The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word&#x2F;line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.</p><p>Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.</p><h4 id="Velosofy"><a href="#Velosofy" class="headerlink" title="Velosofy"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.velosofy.com/" >Velosofy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.</p><p>Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is <a href="#blender">Blender</a>, the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.</p><h2 id="5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Making a Great Intro"></a>5 Tips for Making a Great Intro</h2><p>Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.</p><h4 id="1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds"><a href="#1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep it Under 10 Seconds"></a>1. Keep it Under 10 Seconds</h4><p>Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.</p><p>Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.</p><h4 id="2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding"><a href="#2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding" class="headerlink" title="2. Match Your Channel’s Branding"></a>2. Match Your Channel’s Branding</h4><p>Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.</p><p>Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Music"><a href="#3-Use-Music" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Music"></a>3. Use Music</h4><p>Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.</p><h4 id="4-Include-Your-Channel-Name"><a href="#4-Include-Your-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="4. Include Your Channel Name"></a>4. Include Your Channel Name</h4><p>This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.</p><h4 id="5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro"><a href="#5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro"></a>5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro</h4><p>Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.</p><p> What’s your YouTube intro like?

However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>Smartphone cameras, especially the newest models, are capable of recording great videos.

However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-2"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-2" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>Smartphone cameras, especially the newest models, are capable of recording great videos.

The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Mastering-AdSense-on-YouTube-A-Beginner’s-Guide"><a href="#Mastering-AdSense-on-YouTube-A-Beginner’s-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Mastering AdSense on YouTube: A Beginner’s Guide"></a>Mastering AdSense on YouTube: A Beginner’s Guide</h2><h1 id="How-to-Use-AdSense-for-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Use-AdSense-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Use AdSense for YouTube"></a>How to Use AdSense for YouTube</h1><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)<h5 id="Richard-Bennett-4"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-4" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Now, since your YouTube channel has a large of subscribers and views, you start thinking to make money by using YouTube AdSense.

Finding Your Money in AdSense</h3><p>Intuitively, many YouTube creators think that the first thing they see when they open up AdSense should be their daily earnings. This is not the case. Besides how much money you have made, AdSense keeps track of a lot of things the average YouTuber will not find useful. Getting to a report on your daily earnings actually takes a bit of navigation.</p><p>First, click on Performance Report near the top of your screen in AdSense. In the next page there will be a dropdown menu that says Days. Click on that menu and change it to Products.</p><p>In Products, scroll down until you get to a chart where there are two options: <strong>Hosted AdSense for Content</strong> and <strong>AdSense for Content</strong>. AdSense for Content relates to a personal website. For information about your YouTube channel click on <strong>Hosted AdSense for Content</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-performance-report.JPG"                      alt="adsense performance report"                ></p><p>The next page is a report of how much money you have made from monetizing your YouTube channel.

How are my earnings determined?"></a>2. How are my earnings determined?</h3><p>How much money you make through AdSense depends on your <a class="link"   href="https://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/cpm/" >CPMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and EPMs. CPM is an acronym for “cost per mille” and indicates how much money and advertiser is paying for 1000 impressions of an ad. RPM is your revenue per 1000 impressions.</p><p>A lot of YouTubers new to AdSense assume that “per thousand impressions” means “per thousand views”, and that is incorrect. Besides the fact that not all views are monetized, impressions are not views. They are ad clicks. For long, skippable, video ads an “impression” is when a viewer watches the ad to the end instead of skipping it.</p><p>CPMs vary depending on the type of ad, where it is being run, and current advertising trends. Advertisers pay more for certain kinds of ads or for ad space in more popular videos. Beware of MCN scams claiming they can guarantee you a certain CPM; they cannot. Which ads are displayed in your videos is determined automatically by YouTube’s system and depends on factors like how you categorized your videos and how many views they have.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-I-get-paid"><a href="#3-How-do-I-get-paid" class="headerlink" title="3. How do I get paid?"></a>3. How do I get paid?</h3><p>There are five different ways to get paid through AdSense: Check, Western Union Quick Cash, Wire Transfer, Rapida, or an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Generally, AdSense will begin the process of paying you your monthly earnings on the 21st of the following month. How long it takes to get your money after that depends on your payment method.</p><p>Using <strong>Western Union Quick Cash</strong> you can pick your cash up at your Western Union branch the same day.</p><p><strong>EFTs</strong> get your money to you within seven business days after the 21st.</p><p><strong>Checks</strong> can take two to four weeks to arrive in the mail.</p><p><strong>Wire Transfers</strong> and <strong>Rapida</strong> can each take up to 15 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-payment.jpg"                      alt="adsense payment"                ></p><p>In order to be paid you will have to earn enough to reach the payment threshold, which is $100. So, if you only earn $5 in a month, you should not expect to receive a payment for that month. You will receive your first payment after you earn $100.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Making money with YouTube Adsense is one of the best media that is reliable, easy to use, and better than any other ways of creating money.

Besides how much money you have made, AdSense keeps track of a lot of things the average YouTuber will not find useful. Getting to a report on your daily earnings actually takes a bit of navigation.</p><p>First, click on Performance Report near the top of your screen in AdSense. In the next page there will be a dropdown menu that says Days. Click on that menu and change it to Products.</p><p>In Products, scroll down until you get to a chart where there are two options: <strong>Hosted AdSense for Content</strong> and <strong>AdSense for Content</strong>.

How are my earnings determined?"></a>2. How are my earnings determined?</h3><p>How much money you make through AdSense depends on your <a class="link"   href="https://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/cpm/" >CPMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and EPMs. CPM is an acronym for “cost per mille” and indicates how much money and advertiser is paying for 1000 impressions of an ad. RPM is your revenue per 1000 impressions.</p><p>A lot of YouTubers new to AdSense assume that “per thousand impressions” means “per thousand views”, and that is incorrect. Besides the fact that not all views are monetized, impressions are not views. They are ad clicks. For long, skippable, video ads an “impression” is when a viewer watches the ad to the end instead of skipping it.</p><p>CPMs vary depending on the type of ad, where it is being run, and current advertising trends. Advertisers pay more for certain kinds of ads or for ad space in more popular videos. Beware of MCN scams claiming they can guarantee you a certain CPM; they cannot. Which ads are displayed in your videos is determined automatically by YouTube’s system and depends on factors like how you categorized your videos and how many views they have.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-How-do-I-get-paid-1"><a href="#3-How-do-I-get-paid-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

How do I get paid?</h3><p>There are five different ways to get paid through AdSense: Check, Western Union Quick Cash, Wire Transfer, Rapida, or an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Generally, AdSense will begin the process of paying you your monthly earnings on the 21st of the following month. How long it takes to get your money after that depends on your payment method.</p><p>Using <strong>Western Union Quick Cash</strong> you can pick your cash up at your Western Union branch the same day.</p><p><strong>EFTs</strong> get your money to you within seven business days after the 21st.</p><p><strong>Checks</strong> can take two to four weeks to arrive in the mail.</p><p><strong>Wire Transfers</strong> and <strong>Rapida</strong> can each take up to 15 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-payment.jpg"                      alt="adsense payment"                ></p><p>In order to be paid you will have to earn enough to reach the payment threshold, which is $100. So, if you only earn $5 in a month, you should not expect to receive a payment for that month.

How long it takes to get your money after that depends on your payment method.</p><p>Using <strong>Western Union Quick Cash</strong> you can pick your cash up at your Western Union branch the same day.</p><p><strong>EFTs</strong> get your money to you within seven business days after the 21st.</p><p><strong>Checks</strong> can take two to four weeks to arrive in the mail.</p><p><strong>Wire Transfers</strong> and <strong>Rapida</strong> can each take up to 15 days.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-payment.jpg"                      alt="adsense payment"                ></p><p>In order to be paid you will have to earn enough to reach the payment threshold, which is $100. So, if you only earn $5 in a month, you should not expect to receive a payment for that month. You will receive your first payment after you earn $100.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Making money with YouTube Adsense is one of the best media that is reliable, easy to use, and better than any other ways of creating money.

However, this option is missing in the recent iOS devices versions. Therefore, many users search for possible ways to post a video on YouTube from iPhone. For this, you have to put some considerations into place before moving on. The video title length should not exceed 100 characters, while the description is maintained at 5,000 characters. Also, ensure the video length doesn’t exceed 15 minutes. Let’s roll out the best ways to upload your videos and make that big catch on subscribers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-youtube-video-from-iphone-1.png"                      alt="how to upload youtube video from iphone"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [ How to upload a video to YouTube from iPhone or iPad](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Why your phone doesn’t post videos to YouTube](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Make your YouTube video better with Filmora](#Part 3)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-upload-a-video-to-YouTube-from-iPhone-or-iPad"><a href="#How-to-upload-a-video-to-YouTube-from-iPhone-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to upload a video to YouTube from iPhone or iPad"></a>How to upload a video to YouTube from iPhone or iPad</h2><p>Are you ready to start on that big adventure and share your videos on YouTube?

What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/MacBook_Pro_lyrx-withsinger-tv.png"                      border="0"                >LYRX is an easy-to-use karaoke software with the professional features karaoke hosts need to perform with precision.

What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>You use YouTube to watch videos, post your own content, and build up a following. That is how YouTube works for you. This article is about how YouTube works technically. There are a lot of steps which occur between you clicking ‘upload’ and a viewer clicking ‘play’. Understanding this process can be useful to YouTubers because it can help shed light on where problems may be occurring when you have issues uploading or watching videos. Generally when there is a problem it is on your end and there are multiple simple things you can do to fix it.</p><p>This article will explain what goes on behind the scenes when you upload a video, where that video really goes, and what happens when somebody clicks play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Does-YouTube-Work-3"><a href="#How-Does-YouTube-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does YouTube Work"></a>How Does YouTube Work</h2><h4 id="1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload-3"><a href="#1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload-3" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens When You Upload?"></a>1. What Happens When You Upload?</h4><p>When you upload a video your computer or device packages it into IP packets. Packets are fragments of information containing both data from your video and the address you are sending it to, in this case YouTube. The packets are encoded into radio signals which are sent through a wifi or cellular network. Your video travels through switches and routers on the internet until they reach YouTube’s servers. Your video is then reassembled and stored.</p><p>If uploading takes a long time for you it probably has nothing to do with YouTube; there is a lot that needs to happen for your video to even get there. How long the upload process takes depends on a number of factors including how many devices share your internet connection, how strong your wifi signal is, and the age of your router. If your uploads are taking too long consider compressing your videos before you upload them. You can also try uploading from your college campus or public libraries as institutions like these tend to have fast internet speeds.</p><h4 id="2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3"><a href="#2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

You should also keep an eye on the length and file size limits. The more basic things you need to consider carefully when you upload are the title, description, and tags of your video. These are part of what determines if and where your video comes up in people’s search results. There are also slightly more advanced video specs, like your video’s resolution, which will be helpful for you to understand as somebody who will be producing video content frequently. These sorts of specs will affect how long it takes your videos to upload and how much of the quality they maintain.</p><h4 id="1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be"><a href="#1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="1.  How Long Can my Video Be?"></a>1.  How Long Can my Video Be?</h4><p>By default, your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long. You can post longer videos by going to the upload page and clicking on ‘Increase your Limit’ at the bottom. After you have followed the steps to verify your account you will be able to post videos that are a maximum of 11 hours long.</p><h4 id="2-How-Big-a-File-Can-I-Upload"><a href="#2-How-Big-a-File-Can-I-Upload" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you follow the same steps for posting videos longer than 15 minutes then you can also increase your maximum file size to 128GB.</p><h4 id="3-Other-Basics"><a href="#3-Other-Basics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Other Basics"></a>3.  Other Basics</h4><p>After you click the ‘upload’ button on YouTube you are taken to a page where you choose a category for your video and add a title, description, and tags. These are all important for getting hits so you should put some thought into them.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Keep your title under 70 characters so none of it disappears into a ‘…’. The best titles make people curious or elicit an emotional response. Terms like ‘video’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ are often typed into people’s searches so if they apply to your video it can help to put them in the title.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> A short synopsis of your video which includes your most important keyword. You have about three lines before your text is hidden by a ‘show more’ tab. If you are including the URL of your channel or other videos then you should make sure they are above the ‘show more’.</p><p> <strong>Tags:</strong> Use a lot of them. These are the keywords and terms people will be searching for when they find your video. YouTube will suggest some after you start adding. A quick way to find good keywords to use is to search for videos similar to yours and check out their tags. A while ago YouTube started hiding video tags by default but you can download a free, YouTube-certified, extension for Google Chrome which will allow you to see them from vidIQ.com.</p><h4 id="4-Digging-Deeper"><a href="#4-Digging-Deeper" class="headerlink" title="4.  Digging Deeper"></a>4.  Digging Deeper</h4><p>To get your viewers to subscribe to your channel you will need to make sure your videos are not losing quality when you upload them. Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large.

YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube"></a>Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube</h2><p>Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:</p><p>1.

You should also keep an eye on the length and file size limits. The more basic things you need to consider carefully when you upload are the title, description, and tags of your video. These are part of what determines if and where your video comes up in people’s search results. There are also slightly more advanced video specs, like your video’s resolution, which will be helpful for you to understand as somebody who will be producing video content frequently. These sorts of specs will affect how long it takes your videos to upload and how much of the quality they maintain.</p><h4 id="1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be-1"><a href="#1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Other Basics"></a>3.  Other Basics</h4><p>After you click the ‘upload’ button on YouTube you are taken to a page where you choose a category for your video and add a title, description, and tags. These are all important for getting hits so you should put some thought into them.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Keep your title under 70 characters so none of it disappears into a ‘…’. The best titles make people curious or elicit an emotional response. Terms like ‘video’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ are often typed into people’s searches so if they apply to your video it can help to put them in the title.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> A short synopsis of your video which includes your most important keyword. You have about three lines before your text is hidden by a ‘show more’ tab. If you are including the URL of your channel or other videos then you should make sure they are above the ‘show more’.</p><p> <strong>Tags:</strong> Use a lot of them. These are the keywords and terms people will be searching for when they find your video. YouTube will suggest some after you start adding. A quick way to find good keywords to use is to search for videos similar to yours and check out their tags. A while ago YouTube started hiding video tags by default but you can download a free, YouTube-certified, extension for Google Chrome which will allow you to see them from vidIQ.com.</p><h4 id="4-Digging-Deeper-1"><a href="#4-Digging-Deeper-1" class="headerlink" title="4.  Digging Deeper"></a>4.  Digging Deeper</h4><p>To get your viewers to subscribe to your channel you will need to make sure your videos are not losing quality when you upload them. Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.</p><p>YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;1722171.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube-1"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube"></a>Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube</h2><p>Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:</p><p>1.

You can still share a private video with a limited number of people (as long as they have Google accounts).</p><p>The <strong>“Scheduled”</strong> option is available for choosing a future date and time to make the video available to viewers.

In the meanwhile, you can write a title, description and add relevant tags for your video so that YouTube knows what search results to include it in and viewers can find it. Remember that YouTube is the second biggest search engine on the Internet, so take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >optimize your keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail-2"><a href="#Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Choose your thumbnail"></a>Step 5: Choose your thumbnail</h4><p>Once your video uploading is complete, it is time to choose a creative thumbnail for your video.

Once you have selected your privacy level, simply upload your video from your device storage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-youtube-privacy-setting.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Upload"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Manage-the-upload-3"><a href="#Step-4-Manage-the-upload-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Manage the upload"></a>Step 4: Manage the upload</h4><p>As soon as you have confirmed your video upload, you will find a progress bar on the screen. It will take some time depending on factors such as the resolution of the video and how long it is. In the meanwhile, you can write a title, description and add relevant tags for your video so that YouTube knows what search results to include it in and viewers can find it. Remember that YouTube is the second biggest search engine on the Internet, so take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >optimize your keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail-3"><a href="#Step-5-Choose-your-thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Choose your thumbnail"></a>Step 5: Choose your thumbnail</h4><p>Once your video uploading is complete, it is time to choose a creative thumbnail for your video. The system provides you with three options to choose from automatically, all of which will be screenshots from your video. It is usually better to<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload your own custom thumbnail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as thumbnails are a very important factor in attracting viewers.

Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.</p><p>Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.</p><h2 id="Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?<p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP. They made it easier for Shorts content creators to get into the program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal"><a href="#Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal" class="headerlink" title="Q7.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP.

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-writer-free-word-processor-1x.3d9c80d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633281&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/2_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Monthly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers. It would be much more beneficial to your channel to build good relationships with other YouTubers to possibly collaborate on a video together in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Nov 01, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>In the ten years that I’ve been a YouTuber, I’ve made a lot of mistakes.

This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting.

Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL-2"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched-2"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy-2"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

And as you probably know, it can be tough to work fast and get good results when your hardware or laptop isn’t strong enough to power your software properly and allow you to work at the pace you want.</p><p>The best laptops for video editing in 2018 have three things in common. First, they have top-of-the-line display technology for color accuracy, color depth, and clarity. Next, they have discrete (dedicated) Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with accompanying RAM to enable them to handle video processing fast without compromising other system functions. And finally, they have Intel core i7 CPU processors and Solid-State Drives (SSD) for faster overall performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018"><a href="#THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018" class="headerlink" title="THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018"></a>THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018</h2><p>The top 3 laptops below are quite impressive.

It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.</p><p>Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.</p><p>The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.</p><p>The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2"><a href="#3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.</p><p>Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.</p><p>On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3.

And as you probably know, it can be tough to work fast and get good results when your hardware or laptop isn’t strong enough to power your software properly and allow you to work at the pace you want.</p><p>The best laptops for video editing in 2018 have three things in common. First, they have top-of-the-line display technology for color accuracy, color depth, and clarity. Next, they have discrete (dedicated) Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with accompanying RAM to enable them to handle video processing fast without compromising other system functions. And finally, they have Intel core i7 CPU processors and Solid-State Drives (SSD) for faster overall performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018-3"><a href="#THE-TOP-3-LAPTOPS-FOR-EDITING-VIDEO-IN-2018-3" class="headerlink" title="THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018"></a>THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018</h2><p>The top 3 laptops below are quite impressive.

It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.</p><p>Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-DELL-XPS-15-3"><a href="#2-DELL-XPS-15-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.</p><p>The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.</p><p>The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2-3"><a href="#3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2-3" class="headerlink" title="3.
