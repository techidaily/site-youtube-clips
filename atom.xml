The apps listed above help you in this, and you can easily prepare attractive and engaging short clips pretty quickly using any of them.

At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions.

They work with both YouTubers and Instagrammers.</p><p>A lot of big fashion brands like Calvin Klein, Madewell, and Gap can be found on Revfluence. This platform is a must if you have a lifestyle, beauty, or fashion channel.</p><p>On Revfluence you can browse through brands instead of waiting for them to contact you. You choose which companies you want to endorse, so you never have to worry about losing your integrity in the eyes of your subscribers. Once you find a sponsor, you maintain control over how you choose to collaborate with them.</p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-tapinfluence.jpg"                      alt="Alternatives to FameBit - Tapinfluence"                ></strong></p><h4 id="TapInfluence-3"><a href="#TapInfluence-3" class="headerlink" title="TapInfluence"></a><strong>TapInfluence</strong></h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.tapinfluence.com/" >TapInfluence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might initially seem more brand-focused than equal, like FameBit, because it makes you wait for brands to select you. You are not simply on-call for any brand willing to pay, though.</p><p>After a brand approaches you, you get to examine their offer and decide whether you would feel proud to be associated with them.</p><p>The main thing that sets TapInfluence apart from other platforms where brands approach you is their attitude towards influencers and the way they define influence.</p><p>Some creators get turned off by the word ‘influencer’, and it is easy to understand why. Your subscriber count is important when you want to participate in an ad campaign, but your subscribers are not just numbers and you are not some kind of puppetmaster ‘influencing’ them for monetary gain.</p><p>TapInfluence values authenticity and works with brands that hold that same value. Your ability to be genuine with your audience is never compromised because it is that honest relationship that makes you valuable to brands.</p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-izea.jpg"                      alt="Alternatives to FameBit - Izea"                ></strong></p><h4 id="Izea-3"><a href="#Izea-3" class="headerlink" title="Izea"></a><strong>Izea</strong></h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://izea.com/" >Izea’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> motto states that they champion the creators. They value you for whatever it is you already do, be it ranting vlogs or educational content.</p><p>When you create your profile on Izea you connect your YouTube account, and any other social media account you open to use for branded content. You also describe your audience and state your asking price.</p><p>Brands distribute their sponsorship opportunities to select groups of creators based on what they are looking for. Sponsors may approach you, or you can take matters into your own hands and approach brands with creative pitches.</p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-readypulse.jpg"                      alt="Alternatives to FameBit - ReadyPulse"                ></strong></p><h4 id="ReadyPulse-3"><a href="#ReadyPulse-3" class="headerlink" title="ReadyPulse"></a><strong>ReadyPulse</strong></h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.readypulse.com/" >ReadyPulse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is different from both FameBit and the other platforms on this list because you do not join brands for specific campaigns, you become a brand ambassador.</p><p>The idea is that you continue being you – creating the same style of content you already do – but you also have a relationship with a brand that you openly support and advocate for. The trust your subscribers have in you is supposed to be extended to your associated brands.</p><p>This is excellent if you have the opportunity to become a brand ambassador for a company you respect and are excited to work with. You can get all kinds of perks – like discounts and early releases – from your partner brand, and there is no reason you should not want your subscribers to trust the brand that you trust.</p><p>It becomes problematic if you find yourself matched with brands you do not have total confidence in, although ReadyPulse does try to match brands with influencers who are already fans of them.</p><p>Only you can decide if becoming a brand ambassador is right for you and your audience.</p><p> Do you know about any other sites like Famebit?</p><p>If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>, which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps you to make money by making videos much easier.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="The-Producer’s-Playbook-Strategies-to-Win-Over-YouTube-Viewers"><a href="#The-Producer’s-Playbook-Strategies-to-Win-Over-YouTube-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="The Producer’s Playbook: Strategies to Win Over YouTube Viewers"></a>The Producer’s Playbook: Strategies to Win Over YouTube Viewers</h2><h1 id="10-Tips-For-Shooting-Profesional-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#10-Tips-For-Shooting-Profesional-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips For Shooting Profesional YouTube Videos"></a>10 Tips For Shooting Profesional YouTube Videos</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-4"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-4" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> We have mentioned before about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the equipment you should have to start your YouTube video shooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, however, being methodical in your approach to the video making process and knowing exactly what and where you are going to stage and record will increase the quality of the content.

By doing this, you’ll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set.

Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning.

You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="9.

YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.</p><p> By switching to portrait mode, you’ll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.</p><p> In case that you want to convert your portrait video to landscape, do not miss this article about <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/convert-portrait-video-to-landscape.html" >How to Convert A Portrait Video to Landscape. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises-3"><a href="#7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Keep The Shot in Focus</h4><p> You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won’t be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod-3"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.</p><p> In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.</p><p> We have chosen some of the <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html" >best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.</p><p> The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video’s aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Videos without Any Software Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Hopefully, the tips we provided in this article are going to help you create better YouTube videos.

So, the steps can be divided into three main categories roughly as follows. But remember to get deep within them to get desirable outputs.</p><p>Before you begin creating awesome videos, you got to set up your YouTube account. Activating YouTube is relatively straightforward if you already own a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite YouTubemusic channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p><strong>1 – Preparation</strong></p><p>Prepare, prepare, and prepare! Yes, there’s nothing more required than being prepared beforehand. We know that you’d like to be one of the best music channels on YouTube, but you have to step ahead by being niche down.</p><p>Take instances from different categories mentioned above. Select your preferences and set your YouTube channel to ‘Musician’ type before anything else. Try mixing things up than making those traditional music channels.</p><p>To add variety, you can also interview your fans and bandmates. And, this step also includes picking memorable names to stick in the brains of people.</p><p><strong>2 – Make music videos</strong></p><p>Now, it’s time to ramp up your step and make actual music videos. This is also when you’re looking for the best equipment out there. And, these could be the best audio mixers, best editing program, best mikes, and more for your music channel creation.</p><p>Well, you can quickly figure out this equipment based on your selection. For example, let’s suppose you’re going to make a pop YouTube music channel, and then you’ll be looking for editors to shoot your head against those time-consuming timestamps.</p><p>Although you’ll find them excellent as it’s your interest, you know, what’s that another important thing that is almost common in creating any of the YouTube music channels?</p><p>It’s a video editor or editing program to compile your music and make it presentable to show on YouTube.</p><p>Over time, you will set up your editing style. However, it is best to initially consider the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong></p><p>Some video editing software programs are free, while others cost a lot. Sign up for free trials, do your research, and understand the limitations of the requirements and the applications you need.

Activating YouTube is relatively straightforward if you already own a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite YouTubemusic channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p><strong>1 – Preparation</strong></p><p>Prepare, prepare, and prepare! Yes, there’s nothing more required than being prepared beforehand. We know that you’d like to be one of the best music channels on YouTube, but you have to step ahead by being niche down.</p><p>Take instances from different categories mentioned above. Select your preferences and set your YouTube channel to ‘Musician’ type before anything else. Try mixing things up than making those traditional music channels.</p><p>To add variety, you can also interview your fans and bandmates. And, this step also includes picking memorable names to stick in the brains of people.</p><p><strong>2 – Make music videos</strong></p><p>Now, it’s time to ramp up your step and make actual music videos.

For example, let’s suppose you’re going to make a pop YouTube music channel, and then you’ll be looking for editors to shoot your head against those time-consuming timestamps.</p><p>Although you’ll find them excellent as it’s your interest, you know, what’s that another important thing that is almost common in creating any of the YouTube music channels?</p><p>It’s a video editor or editing program to compile your music and make it presentable to show on YouTube.</p><p>Over time, you will set up your editing style. However, it is best to initially consider the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong></p><p>Some video editing software programs are free, while others cost a lot.

We know that you’d like to be one of the best music channels on YouTube, but you have to step ahead by being niche down.</p><p>Take instances from different categories mentioned above. Select your preferences and set your YouTube channel to ‘Musician’ type before anything else. Try mixing things up than making those traditional music channels.</p><p>To add variety, you can also interview your fans and bandmates.

So, the steps can be divided into three main categories roughly as follows. But remember to get deep within them to get desirable outputs.</p><p>Before you begin creating awesome videos, you got to set up your YouTube account. Activating YouTube is relatively straightforward if you already own a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite YouTubemusic channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p><strong>1 – Preparation</strong></p><p>Prepare, prepare, and prepare! Yes, there’s nothing more required than being prepared beforehand. We know that you’d like to be one of the best music channels on YouTube, but you have to step ahead by being niche down.</p><p>Take instances from different categories mentioned above. Select your preferences and set your YouTube channel to ‘Musician’ type before anything else. Try mixing things up than making those traditional music channels.</p><p>To add variety, you can also interview your fans and bandmates. And, this step also includes picking memorable names to stick in the brains of people.</p><p><strong>2 – Make music videos</strong></p><p>Now, it’s time to ramp up your step and make actual music videos. This is also when you’re looking for the best equipment out there. And, these could be the best audio mixers, best editing program, best mikes, and more for your music channel creation.</p><p>Well, you can quickly figure out this equipment based on your selection. For example, let’s suppose you’re going to make a pop YouTube music channel, and then you’ll be looking for editors to shoot your head against those time-consuming timestamps.</p><p>Although you’ll find them excellent as it’s your interest, you know, what’s that another important thing that is almost common in creating any of the YouTube music channels?</p><p>It’s a video editor or editing program to compile your music and make it presentable to show on YouTube.</p><p>Over time, you will set up your editing style. However, it is best to initially consider the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong></p><p>Some video editing software programs are free, while others cost a lot. Sign up for free trials, do your research, and understand the limitations of the requirements and the applications you need. You might want to stick with affordable options such as Filmora if money is a factor.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmorax boxpng "                ></p><p>The ideal professional video editor for YouTubers - Wondershare Filmora, assists you in the crop, cut, rotate, reverse videos and provides various advanced features like Green Screen, PIP, or audio mixing.</p><p>What’s more, you can look for lots of effects on gaming, fashion, education, tutorial, sports, etc.</p><p><strong>3 – Promote your YouTube channel</strong></p><p>Once done with making your first YouTube music channel, the most common promotion platforms are social media handles.

This live streaming platform takes your experience to another level. You can use it to make crafts, play games, attract broadcasters, and many more. Twitch was launched in 2011, and since then, it has attracted millions of users, managing a database of about 4 million broadcasters by early 2020. With it, users can stream their activities as others watch in real-time. Just browse a category to find a stream.</p><p>You can also follow streamers that you like on the platform and get updates and notifications immediately after they are posted. But how do you start a career on a platform like Twitch? You need to broadcast and gather a large following. You can use built-in audiences from other platforms like Facebook. Let’s dive into the core of the matter and look at <strong>how to upload Twitch streams to YouTube</strong> and build your platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-1.png"                      alt="how to upload twitch stream to youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Twitch VOD?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube</a></p><h2 id="What-is-Twitch-VOD"><a href="#What-is-Twitch-VOD" class="headerlink" title="What is Twitch VOD?"></a>What is Twitch VOD?</h2><p>Twitch Video on Demand (VOD) is a recording of previously streamed content. It provides briefings if you missed catching the Twitch live stream. Just watch the VOD from your favorite streamer and be engaged the best way possible. However, VODs don’t last forever. They are removed after two weeks of broadcast. But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.</p><h4 id="How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD"><a href="#How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD" class="headerlink" title="- How to enable Twitch VOD?"></a>- How to enable Twitch VOD?</h4><p>VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They’ll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch</strong><br>Check in the “Channel &amp; Video” section and locate the “Stream Key &amp; Preferences” menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-2.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Click on “Creator Dashboard”</strong><br>Remember, you can enable VODs from your creator dashboard. Just go under the “Settings” tab and click on the “Stream section” of the creator dashboard. Check under the subtitle “VOD Settings” and get the option to store past broadcasts. You can also toggle the slider to store your past broadcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-3.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - click on creator dashboard"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 Click on the “Settings” tab on the left-hand side and go to Stream</strong><br>You’ll get various drop-down menu options. Click on the “Settings” tab and choose the “Stream” option. The system will navigate to a new page, thus setting your preferences for VODs and clips.</p><p><strong>Step 4. Go to “VOD Settings” and toggle on the “Store Past Broadcast.”</strong><br>Ensure you have the toggle option turned ON under the “VOD Settings.” If it’s “ON,” you’ll realize the toggle will be purple, with a checkmark in it. Twitch will be confirmed to be enabled if it’s purple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-4.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - how to store twitch vod"                ></p><h4 id="Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD" class="headerlink" title="- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD"></a>- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD</h4><p>These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.</p><h5 id="1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD"><a href="#1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD" class="headerlink" title="1. How long will Twitch store my VOD"></a>1. How long will Twitch store my VOD</h5><p>Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.</p><p>Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.</p><h5 id="2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips"><a href="#2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2.

You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don’t need any additional requirements to use VOD.</p><p>Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.</p><ul><li>To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.</li><li>Then scroll down and click on “Content” &gt; “Video Producer.</li><li>Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”</li><li>Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”</li><li>Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.</li><li>Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.</li></ul><p>When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.</p><p>The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer’s channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.</p><ul><li>To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.</li><li>Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.</li><li>Finally, create a title and publish your Clip.

This live streaming platform takes your experience to another level. You can use it to make crafts, play games, attract broadcasters, and many more. Twitch was launched in 2011, and since then, it has attracted millions of users, managing a database of about 4 million broadcasters by early 2020. With it, users can stream their activities as others watch in real-time. Just browse a category to find a stream.</p><p>You can also follow streamers that you like on the platform and get updates and notifications immediately after they are posted. But how do you start a career on a platform like Twitch? You need to broadcast and gather a large following. You can use built-in audiences from other platforms like Facebook. Let’s dive into the core of the matter and look at <strong>how to upload Twitch streams to YouTube</strong> and build your platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-1.png"                      alt="how to upload twitch stream to youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-7"><a href="#In-this-article-7" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Twitch VOD?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube</a></p><h2 id="What-is-Twitch-VOD-3"><a href="#What-is-Twitch-VOD-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Twitch VOD?"></a>What is Twitch VOD?</h2><p>Twitch Video on Demand (VOD) is a recording of previously streamed content. It provides briefings if you missed catching the Twitch live stream. Just watch the VOD from your favorite streamer and be engaged the best way possible. However, VODs don’t last forever. They are removed after two weeks of broadcast. But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.</p><h4 id="How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD-3"><a href="#How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD-3" class="headerlink" title="- How to enable Twitch VOD?"></a>- How to enable Twitch VOD?</h4><p>VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They’ll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch</strong><br>Check in the “Channel &amp; Video” section and locate the “Stream Key &amp; Preferences” menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-2.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Click on “Creator Dashboard”</strong><br>Remember, you can enable VODs from your creator dashboard. Just go under the “Settings” tab and click on the “Stream section” of the creator dashboard. Check under the subtitle “VOD Settings” and get the option to store past broadcasts. You can also toggle the slider to store your past broadcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-3.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - click on creator dashboard"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 Click on the “Settings” tab on the left-hand side and go to Stream</strong><br>You’ll get various drop-down menu options. Click on the “Settings” tab and choose the “Stream” option. The system will navigate to a new page, thus setting your preferences for VODs and clips.</p><p><strong>Step 4. Go to “VOD Settings” and toggle on the “Store Past Broadcast.”</strong><br>Ensure you have the toggle option turned ON under the “VOD Settings.” If it’s “ON,” you’ll realize the toggle will be purple, with a checkmark in it. Twitch will be confirmed to be enabled if it’s purple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-4.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - how to store twitch vod"                ></p><h4 id="Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD-3"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD-3" class="headerlink" title="- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD"></a>- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD</h4><p>These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.</p><h5 id="1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD-3"><a href="#1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD-3" class="headerlink" title="1. How long will Twitch store my VOD"></a>1. How long will Twitch store my VOD</h5><p>Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.</p><p>Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.</p><h5 id="2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips-3"><a href="#2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips"></a>2. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips</h5><p>Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don’t need any additional requirements to use VOD.</p><p>Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.</p><ul><li>To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.</li><li>Then scroll down and click on “Content” &gt; “Video Producer.</li><li>Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”</li><li>Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”</li><li>Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.</li><li>Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.</li></ul><p>When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.</p><p>The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer’s channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.</p><ul><li>To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.</li><li>Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.</li><li>Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You’ll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip’s link to other social media networks.</li></ul><h2 id="What-is-the-benefit-of-uploading-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube-3"><a href="#What-is-the-benefit-of-uploading-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube"></a>What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube</h2><p>You stand to gain a lot when you upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube.</p><h4 id="1-To-enlighten-your-followers-3"><a href="#1-To-enlighten-your-followers-3" class="headerlink" title="1) To enlighten your followers"></a>1) To enlighten your followers</h4><p>Your followers will see your streams and make the best decisions.

It is okay for you to grow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/advanced%20video%20cutter.png"                      alt="advanced%20video%20cutter"                ></p><h2 id="Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have-3"><a href="#Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have-3" class="headerlink" title="Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have"></a>Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have</h2><p>As much as the enthusiasm is brewing to get on your mac and upload the video you just shot, there are certain elements you need to implement to make a cool video for YouTube. Beginners sometimes feel their content is the best, the excitement of posting their very first series can be overwhelming. Sometimes, it blocks off other ideas for making the video better.</p><p>However, having amazing content dies not to exclude the need for the right editing technique. Here are five methods for editing your YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="1-Control-the-video-duration-3"><a href="#1-Control-the-video-duration-3" class="headerlink" title="1.Control the video duration"></a>1.Control the video duration</h3><p>The length of a particular scene can have different meanings depending on how long or short it is in a video. This means the duration can impact the message you are trying to pass across to your viewers, hence it is important to know what places to accelerate and cut in the video.</p><p>You can have a system where each part of the content is labeled in their order of importance such as A, B, C. This means from the most important to the least important. Consequently, you will be able to sieve through the content and make the appropriate changes while editing the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-mac-change-default-transition-duration.jpg"                                     ></p><h3 id="2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video-3"><a href="#2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Customize the intro and end of the video"></a>2.Customize the intro and end of the video</h3><p>It is possible to grab the attention of the viewer in the intro and even more likely to lose someone once the opening montage comes in. Creating an intro that is captivating and appealing to drag the audience to your video is an important technique for editing your videos. Also, the end of the video, from the signing out to the closing montage has to appeal to the audience. You will be surprised by the number of people that love seeing end credits if the closing montage is good. Customize the intro and the end of the video so the audience is tuned all through.</p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best YouTube Banner Size and Channel Art Dimension (The Ultimate Guide) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Add Logo or Watermark to YouTube Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters-3"><a href="#3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Use Cool transitions or filters"></a>3.Use Cool transitions or filters</h3><p>If there is anything the audience love to see, it is the way you move from different points in the vudeo.

It’s easy to carry around, and the ability to simply connect to a smartphone means you can set up and shoot your video on the fly.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: This mic, although it has a great range, can also pick up subtle movements you make as it is clipped onto you.

If you are a gamer or creating videos primarily from your desk, this is a perfectly suitable microphone for you to start your YouTube journey with.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The audio quality of this mic can help you get the job done, but it won’t blow you away. The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isn’t a wide range. It’s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50-3"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $50"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $50</strong></h2><h4 id="Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99-3"><a href="#Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99-3" class="headerlink" title="Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99"></a><strong>Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras.

The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera. This is a good microphone for vlogging or interviews.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The TAKSTAR SGC requires one AA battery, so you’ll have to remember to carry a backup every time you film.</p><p>Limited to a vocal subject standing 4-5 feet away, any more and the microphone will be hard-pressed to pick up the audio without capturing a lot of surround audio.</p><p>The design requires it to be mounted to the camera.

They make it grow and spend more time watching than viewers who are not subscribed. You need 1,000 subscribers to monetize your channel.

However, these options may not be available to you depending on where you’re based. AdSense does make payments through electronic wire transfer (EFT – Electronic funds transfer) to virtually every country in the world, and this is the preferred payment option for most people.</p><p>To have your earnings deposited directly into your account through EFT, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide for linking your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><ol><li>Log in to AdSense via: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start" >www.google.com/adsense/start <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left panel menu</li><li>Under ‘Settings’, click ‘Payments’.</li><li>On the ‘Payments’ page, click ‘Manage payment options’.</li><li>Click ‘Add payment method’.</li><li>Next, you’ll be prompted to add your bank account details.

You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).</p><p>Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle. This means that a month’s earnings (assuming they meet the threshold requirement) will be paid next month. Usually, direct deposit payments will be processed between the 21st and 26th of every month. That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.</p><p>In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.</p><p>To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization. And even when you’ve successfully monetized your channel, getting enough views to reach the payment threshold can be tough.</p><p>Don’t let this discourage you from working towards earning income from your YouTube channel.

If you do not meet these requirements you cannot join the YouTube Partner Program and monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>So, the first step to successful monetization on YouTube is to actually grow your channel.

You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p><p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p><p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p><p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p><p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p><h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p><p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist.

If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li></ul><p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring.

Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal.

Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p><p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p><p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p><p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p><p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p><p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p><p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche.

You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p><p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p><p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-1"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p><p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p><p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p><h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-1"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-1" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p><p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-1"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist.

You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p><p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance.

Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p><p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p><p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p><h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-2"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-2" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p><p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-2"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li></ul><p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p><p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p><ol><li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li><li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li></ol><p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p><p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p><p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p><h2 id="Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-2"><a href="#Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-2" class="headerlink" title="Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]"></a>Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]</h2><p>There are some YouTube niches that are easier to monetize than others. That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p><p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p><p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p><p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p><p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p><p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p><p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p><p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p><p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche. They tend to be highly immersed in the YouTube community, disclosing personal information about themselves and sharing their interests with their audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-7"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-7" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>With over <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >300 hours <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, it’s no longer enough just to make a great video. If you want to be found and to be able to monetize your YouTube channel, you’re going to need to find your niche.</p><p>If you’re serious about turning your YouTube hobby into a lucrative career, you’re going to need a niche that not only lets you do the things you’re passionate about but which also gets you the views you need. The perfect niche will be something that your audience is already looking for, not ridiculously competitive, and which still allows you to demonstrate your passion and knowledge.</p><p>It’s not easy finding a perfect niche on YouTube. You’re going to need some creativity, self-awareness, directed intention, and a good deal of thought, so be prepared to invest some time and energy into this process.

Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p><ol><li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li><li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li></ol><p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p><p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p><p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p><h2 id="Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-3"><a href="#Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-3" class="headerlink" title="Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]"></a>Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]</h2><p>There are some YouTube niches that are easier to monetize than others. That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p><p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p><p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p><p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p><p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p><p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p><p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p><p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p><p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche. They tend to be highly immersed in the YouTube community, disclosing personal information about themselves and sharing their interests with their audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload

With such a large community of music listeners on YouTube, many well-known and lesser-known musicians continue to upload their songs regularly. If you’re a music producer, you’ll probably want to do this as well. However, understanding how to upload music to YouTube might be difficult, so this article is created to assist you.</p><p>When you upload a song to YouTube, it becomes available to the entire globe. Unlike other streaming services, anyone can use YouTube for free. This is a one-of-a-kind platform for sharing music. This is an opportunity that every artist should take advantage of, with a potential audience of billions.</p><p>So, how do you go about uploading songs to YouTube? Regular file formats aren’t applicable; therefore, this is the only challenging component. YouTube does not recognize.mp3 or.mp4 files, which makes things a little more difficult for the average producer. It’s simple to get around this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-music-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="how to upload music to youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Details On Youtube Music</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</a></p><h2 id="Details-On-Youtube-Music"><a href="#Details-On-Youtube-Music" class="headerlink" title="Details On Youtube Music"></a>Details On Youtube Music</h2><p>YouTube recently added ‘YouTube Music’ to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don’t have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don’t want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube’s music.</p><p>Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.</p><p>Even though this is critical for compensating artists, it already restricts the audience’s reach. Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don’t have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn’t have any of these problems.</p><p>YouTube’s other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site’s potential for musical promotion.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?"></a>Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</h2><p>YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.</p><h4 id="Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit"><a href="#Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit"></a>Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit</h4><p>The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube’s blog and Google’s 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it’s a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube’s new 2 GB size restriction.</p><h4 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?</h4><ul><li>YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.</li><li>Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.</li><li>Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production’s audience.</li><li>Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video. The soundtrack can keep the viewer interested in the clip if the video itself is not entertaining.</li></ul><p><strong>How Can I Utilise Music Lawfully In My Youtube Videos?</strong></p><p>If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you’ll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Bouns!

Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?"></a>Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?</h4><p>YouTube’s music library is relatively small. The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it’ll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It’s rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you’ve made them public. This concluded the tutorial on how to upload music to YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Navigating-the-Path-to-Viewable-Reach-Responsibly"><a href="#Navigating-the-Path-to-Viewable-Reach-Responsibly" class="headerlink" title="Navigating the Path to Viewable Reach Responsibly"></a>Navigating the Path to Viewable Reach Responsibly</h2><h1 id="How-to-Buy-YouTube-Views-Everything-You-Need-To-Know"><a href="#How-to-Buy-YouTube-Views-Everything-You-Need-To-Know" class="headerlink" title="How to Buy YouTube Views - Everything You Need To Know"></a>How to Buy YouTube Views - Everything You Need To Know</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>This article has everything you need to know before you buy YouTube views, including:</p><ol><li><a href="#where">Where to Buy Views</a></li><li><a href="#how">How Does it Work?</a></li><li><a href="#what">What to Look for in a Service</a></li><li><a href="#illegal">Is Buying Views Illegal?</a></li><li><a href="#banned">Will Buying Views Get Me Banned From YouTube?</a></li></ol><p><strong>Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p><p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p><p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p><p>This is why <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p><h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>BuyViewsReview</strong></a>.

These will help your search engine rankings.</p><h3 id="1-DEVUMI"><a href="#1-DEVUMI" class="headerlink" title="1. DEVUMI"></a>1. DEVUMI</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p><h3 id="2-BuyViews"><a href="#2-BuyViews" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2.

They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p><h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3. MarketingHeaven</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://themarketingheaven.com/" >MarketingHeaven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p><h3 id="4-500VIEWS"><a href="#4-500VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On <em><a class="link"   href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.</p><h3 id="5-Social-Shop"><a href="#5-Social-Shop" class="headerlink" title="5. Social Shop"></a>5. Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p><h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p><p> What do you think?

Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers.

It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-1"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-1" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-1"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-1" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-1"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-1" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos.

The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p><p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p><p>This is why <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success.

DEVUMI</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p><h3 id="2-BuyViews-2"><a href="#2-BuyViews-2" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2.

They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p><h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven-2"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven-2" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3.

It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p><h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-3"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-3" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>BuyViewsReview</strong></a>. To learn more about the top providers of YouTube views, and how you can avoid scams, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> you want ‘high retention views’ – views where your video has been watched for a significant period, not just clicked on. These will help your search engine rankings.</p><h3 id="1-DEVUMI-3"><a href="#1-DEVUMI-3" class="headerlink" title="1. DEVUMI"></a>1. DEVUMI</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p><h3 id="2-BuyViews-3"><a href="#2-BuyViews-3" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2. BuyViews</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://buyviews.co/" >BuyViews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> come in at a close second to Devumi. They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p><h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven-3"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven-3" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3. MarketingHeaven</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://themarketingheaven.com/" >MarketingHeaven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p><h3 id="4-500VIEWS-3"><a href="#4-500VIEWS-3" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On <em><a class="link"   href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.</p><h3 id="5-Social-Shop-3"><a href="#5-Social-Shop-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Social Shop"></a>5. Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p><h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-3"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-3" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-3"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-3" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-3"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-3" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-3"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-3" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p><p> What do you think? Would you buy YouTube views, or can you get by growing your channel organically?</p><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Gain-More-Views-3"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Gain-More-Views-3"

TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense.

Well, unlike a standard video, working on a sports highlight video can be tough. This is because it needs a lot of editing and we need to handpick the right moments from hours of footage. Though, if you use the right tools, then you can easily work on highlight videos like a pro. In this guide, I will let you know how to create sports videos in a step by step manner.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Highlight Video vs. Skills Video</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Create a Sports Highlight Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important"><a href="#Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is a sports highlight video and why important?"></a>Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</h2><p>As the name suggests, a highlight video basically includes all the vital events of a game in a short duration of time. You can include the details of some players at the start or focus on a particular player as well. Besides that, a sports highlight video would have fast-forward, slow motion, and frozen clips to skip or focus on certain details.</p><p>A lot of times, people don’t have the time to watch the entire game, which can span for a couple of hours. Therefore, they can watch a sports highlight video that would include all the major events of the game and will let them enjoy their thrill in a few moments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sports-highlight-video.jpg"                      alt="Sports Highlight Video"                ></p><p>Besides that, if you are applying for a college&#x2F;academy or just want to showcase your skills, then you can consider making a sports video of an impressive game of yours. You can simply showcase a player and try to highlight their skills in the video.</p><h2 id="Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences"><a href="#Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences"></a>Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences</h2><p>While making a sports video, you might encounter two different types of content – a highlight video and a skills video. As I have mentioned above, a sports highlight video would include the shots of an actual game. You can either focus on the event of a single game or include clips from multiple games that were played in a genuine setup. If you want, you can highlight a particular player while making the video as well.</p><p>On the other hand, a skills video is mostly made to demonstrate the skills of a player and is not focused on the game. In fact, most of the skills videos are made outside of a real game setting. For instance, if you have mastered a skill or would like to demonstrate your game-related actions, then you can make a skills video. Some of these videos are also tutorial game-plays to teach others about a particular skill that they can master.</p><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video" class="headerlink" title="Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video"></a>Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</h2><p>If you want to come up with engaging and visually appealing highlight videos, then consider using a versatile video editor like <strong>Filmora</strong>.

You can also focus on different skills that you found impressive and include them in your sports video.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to come up with an impressive sports highlight video as well. Since you might need to make a lot of edits on a sports video, I would recommend using a diverse tool like Filmora.

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below.

This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt=" Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4.

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below. So, let get started.</p><p>You might be interested in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Playlist of Uploaded Videos and Others’ Video on YouTube&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare FilmoraX</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL-1"><a href="#Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL"></a>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</h2><p>Internet Archive(known as the Wayback Machine) is a website archival system that has been collecting and cataloging websites since 1996. This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt=" Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL-1"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt=" Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites.

The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-7"><a href="#-7" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL-3"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used-3"><a href="#What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used-3" class="headerlink" title="What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?"></a>What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Thumbnails-That-Captivate-A-Professional’s-Guide-to-Visual-Lures"><a href="#Thumbnails-That-Captivate-A-Professional’s-Guide-to-Visual-Lures" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails That Captivate: A Professional’s Guide to Visual Lures"></a>Thumbnails That Captivate: A Professional’s Guide to Visual Lures</h2><h1 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-YouTube-Thumbnails-that-Get-Views"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-YouTube-Thumbnails-that-Get-Views" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Thumbnails that Get Views"></a>The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Thumbnails that Get Views</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-4"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-4" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos.

The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p><p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p><p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p><p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p><p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p><p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p><p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p><p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p><h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p><p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p><p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p><p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p><h4 id="3-Put-It-Together"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p><p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p><p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p><ol><li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li><li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li><li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li><li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol><p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p><p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p><p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p><h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p><p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p><p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p><p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p><p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p><p>Click to check more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p><h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p><p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p><p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p><p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p><h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p><p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p><h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p><p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p><p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser.

Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p><p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p><p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background.

Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p><p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content.

Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p><p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p><p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-1"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="#2.

Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p><p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p><p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p><p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p><p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p><p>Click to check more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p><h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p><p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-1"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-1" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p><p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p><p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics-1"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p><h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p><p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p><h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p><p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p><p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser.

The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-2"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-2" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p><p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p><p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p><p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos.

Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p><p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p><p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily.

Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p><p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used.

Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-2"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-2" class="headerlink" title="#3.

Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p><h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-2"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-2" class="headerlink" title="#5.

Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p><p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p><h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-2"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="#6.

These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p><p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout.

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p><p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-youtube-thumbnail-layout.jpg"                      alt="Popular YouTube Thumbnail Layout"                ></p><h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p><p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p><p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p><p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p><p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p><p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p><p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p><p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p><h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p><p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p><p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p><p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-3"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p><h4 id="3-Put-It-Together-3"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together-3" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p><p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p><p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p><ol><li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li><li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li><li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li><li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol><p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p><p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p><p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p><h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it).

Not only does a thumbnail help attract viewers to your video, but it’s also the first thing people see when they come across your content on the platform. That’s why it’s crucial to put effort into designing an eye-catching thumbnail that accurately represents your video.</p><p>When creating a thumbnail for your Valorant video, it’s important to remember that the recommended size is 1280 x 720 pixels. This will ensure that your thumbnail looks clear and professional on all devices. In addition to size, it’s also essential to consider the composition of your thumbnail.

As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg"                      alt="Locate enhancements features"                ></p><p> Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg"                      alt="Qucik Fix"                ></p><p> Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements.

As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg"                      alt="Locate enhancements features"                ></p><p> Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg"                      alt="Qucik Fix"                ></p><p> Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Filters"                ></p><p> Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Costum Blurring"                ></p><p> Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video. These options are welcome, as sometimes you just do not get what you have expected and you do not want to replace the video you have already uploaded.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Wondershare-Filmora-to-improve-YouTube-videos-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-Wondershare-Filmora-to-improve-YouTube-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos"></a>How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos</h2><p> These are the steps that you need to follow, so as to proceed with high-quality video editing on Filmora:</p><ul><li>Open Wordershare Filmora</li><li>Choose if you want 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio</li><li>Tap Import so as to upload the files</li><li>Drag and drop them, in order to place them in the right order</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-videos.jpg"                      alt="Import Video"                ></p><ul><li>Click Edit and adjust the settings (rotation, contrast, saturation, brightness, hue, auto de-noise and speed)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-contrast-saturation.jpg"                      alt="Adjust Contrast Saturation"                ></p><ul><li>Click OK, and you are done with the improvement of Video Quality</li></ul><p> If you wish to fine-tune the images of the videos and place special filters, you can go ahead as follows:</p><ul><li>Tap the Effect button</li><li>Drag the effect you want to use on the timeline (you can choose from a wide variety of effects, including Bokeh and Light Leaks, Old Film, etc.)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-movie-special-effects.jpg"                      alt="Free Movie Special Effect"                ></p><p> After having finished with the video editing process, you can preview the video and see if it is of acceptable quality standards.

The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset" class="headerlink" title="2.

This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430" class="headerlink" title="3.

Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p><p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p><p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p><h2 id="4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="4.

It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p><p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p><p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p><h2 id="5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="5.

It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p><p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo.

The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, you’ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p><p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p><p> <strong><a href="#razer">1. Razer Man O’War 7.1</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#audiotech">2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#logitec">3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#kraken">4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="#hyper">5. HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset</a></strong></p><h2 id="1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1-3"><a href="#1-Razer-Man-O’-War-7-1-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Razer Man O’ War 7.1"></a><strong>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-manowar-7.1" >Razer Man O’ War 7.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-man-headset1.jpg"                      alt="Razer Man O&#39;War 7.1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $222.48</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox</p><p>This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset-3"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset"></a><strong>2. <a class="link"   href="http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/97d660ada89c32c8/index.html" >Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-technica-headset2.jpg"                      alt="Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $299</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)</p><p>For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430-3"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/product/g430-7-1-surround-sound-gaming-headset" >Logitec Surround Sound Gaming Headset G430 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitec-gaming-headset3.jpg"                      alt="Logitec G430 Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $79.99</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p><p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p><p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p><h2 id="4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset-3"><a href="#4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-kraken-71-v2" >Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma Gaming Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/razer-kraken-headset4.jpg"                      alt="Razer Kraken Chroma Headset"                ></strong></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $96.77</p><p><strong>Compatible with</strong> <strong>:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p><p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p><p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p><h2 id="5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset-3"><a href="#5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p><p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> b and elegant aluminum frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Advanced audio control box</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Virtual 7.1 surround audio</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Interchangeable ear pads</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Premium look and feel at an affordable price</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Inconveniently positioned mute switch</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Relatively short cord limiting movement</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9</h2><p>No doubt gamers would need a lot of effects and overlays to edit a live stream video to show the best effects on the game screen.
