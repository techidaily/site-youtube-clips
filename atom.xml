This is what will make people want to subscribe.</p><h4 id="Talk-about-All-the-Cool-Stuff-You-Do"><a href="#Talk-about-All-the-Cool-Stuff-You-Do" class="headerlink" title="Talk about All the Cool Stuff You Do"></a>Talk about All the Cool Stuff You Do</h4><p>The best channel trailers give viewers a window into your channel. You need to show people what to expect from you as a personality, but you also need to tell them what to expect in terms of your videos.</p><p>Your channel trailer should include information like: what kinds of videos you make, why you make them, and what your upload schedule is.</p><p>Be specific. Instead of saying you make videos about makeup, say you make look tutorials and talk about your favorite styles. Instead of saying you are a gamer, tell your potential subscribers what games you post about and what some of your favorites are.</p><p>A specific schedule is important for getting people to subscribe. Generally, viewers do not subscribe to channels that have not posted in a long time. They subscribe because they do not want to miss out on new content, and if you follow a schedule, they will trust that that new content is on its way.</p><h4 id="Ask-Them-to-Subscribe"><a href="#Ask-Them-to-Subscribe" class="headerlink" title="Ask Them to Subscribe"></a>Ask Them to Subscribe</h4><p>Do not forget to ask the person to view your trailer to subscribe.</p><p>A lot of people go into YouTube thinking people will subscribe if they like their videos, and so making great videos is the only way to get people to subscribe. This is not true.</p><p>Making great videos is the first step to getting subscribers, but the second step is to ask for them. Not everyone subscribes to every channel they visit and enjoy. A person who enjoys your videos is more likely to subscribe if you prompt them to.</p><h4 id="30-Seconds"><a href="#30-Seconds" class="headerlink" title="30 Seconds"></a>30 Seconds</h4><p>The ideal length for a YouTube channel trailer is 30 seconds, or between 30 seconds and 1 minute.</p><p>The people viewing your trailer did not come to YouTube for the purpose of watching it. They are unlikely to give it much time before they continue browsing. This means you need to grab their attention tightly right away, but it also means you need to keep your trailer bite-sized.</p><p>Thirty seconds should be long enough to tell people what your channel is about, show off your personality, and ask them to subscribe. If you take much longer, viewers will click away before they hear your full pitch.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Channel-Trailer-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Channel-Trailer-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Channel Trailer Using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Channel Trailer Using Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Here are a few simple steps to setting up your channel trailer.</p><ol><li>Turn on channel customization.

It can be extremely discouraging at first. More experienced vloggers know that mistakes happen and they are no reason to stop recording. Instead of trying to record a perfect clip it is common for vloggers to remove errors from their videos in editing using jump cuts.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1"><a href="#How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog"></a>How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a Jump Cut?"></a>1. What is a Jump Cut?</h4><p>A jump cut is when you jump from one part of your clip to a later part of that same clip, cutting out the section in-between.</p><p>In movies or tv shows jump cuts can be distracting. In vlogs it is the exact opposite; jump cuts are used to remove distractions. It is not strange for a YouTube video to contain a lot of jump cuts. If you go and re-watch a video by your favorite vlogger you will probably notice that every once in a while the vlogger is suddenly sitting differently or that something else has suddenly changed. That is a jump cut, and chances are you did not even think twice about it when you first watched the video.</p><h4 id="2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video"><a href="#2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video"></a>2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video</h4><p>There are a lot of things you might want to take out of your clips using jump cuts. Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>Repetition</strong>: You may have had to repeat yourself because you misspoke. Or, you might watch your clip back and realize that two sections you intended – perhaps even scripted – are very similar and you only need one.</p><p><strong>Off-Topic Tangents</strong>: Once you get comfortable talking to the camera it is easy to find yourself getting off-topic while recording. These tangents might be funny or feel important, but you should still cut them out of your final video. Rather than scrapping them completely, though, consider giving your tangent its very own video. Successful vloggers post new videos frequently, after all.</p><p><strong>Silence</strong>: Use jump cuts to take out any pauses in your video. Every period of silence is an opportunity for viewers to get distracted and decide to click on something else. Adding music to the background of your video can help with shorter pauses, but cutting out any silence is still a good way to go.</p><p>In the video tutorial below, we will share with you some practical and creative jump cuts tips that you can try in video editing. And most of the jump cuts are done with the cutting features in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos"></a>3. How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos</h4><p>You can make jump cuts in almost every editing program, from free software like Windows Movie Maker to professional programs like Adobe Premiere. Remember no matter which video editing software you are using to edit your videos with jump cut, you need to ensure that the software can scroll through your video clips and audio files frame-by-frame. And some video editors may only allow you to scroll video footage frame by frame. This tutorial is for Filmora Video Editor (Now upgraded to Filmora), but many of the same steps will apply to other software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to trim and cut videos in Windows Movie Maker for Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Open up Filmora Video Editor and add a clip into the timeline. Watch it through, and then revisit sections where you think you might want to make cuts.</p><p>Find a place in your clip that has silence and use the scissors icon to cut your clip into two. Then start playing your clip and pause as soon as you hear sound.</p><p>Make sure your clip is selected, and then go back frame by frame until you hear nothing.</p><p>Use the scissors icon to make another cut. You will now have three clips; one before the silence, the silent pause, and the section where sound starts again. Delete the quiet middle clip.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views"><a href="#4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep video shorter for more views"></a>4. Keep video shorter for more views</h4><p>The videos that get the most views on YouTube are an average of three minutes long. People will use the length of a video as a reason not to click on it. Viewers are also more likely to get distracted and stop watching longer videos before they are over. That does not mean you should not take as long as you need to properly explain your ideas, just that you should be careful your video is not longer than it needs to be. It is common for youtubers to use only about a third of the clip they record. The rest is removed using jump cuts.</p><p>Filmora video editor will help you to be more creative in video editing and saving your time at the same time.

Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>. Check the box next to <strong>Always Show Captions</strong>, and then check   <strong>Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition</strong>. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The <strong>Always Show Captions</strong> feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.</p><p>If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   <strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> . If the language you want is not there select <strong>Auto-Translate</strong>  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.</p><h2 id="Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps"><a href="#Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps"></a>Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to <strong>Video Manager</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.</p><p>2. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose <strong>Subtitles and CC</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Add New</strong> <strong>Subtitles or CC</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.</p><p><strong>Create Subtitles or Closed Captions</strong> will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Upload A File</strong> allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and Set Timings</strong> is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.</p><p><strong>Use Automatic Captioning</strong> will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.</p><p><strong>Use Captioning Software or Services</strong> is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.</p><p>The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use <strong>Automatic Captioning</strong>. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/exclusive-list-of-premium-online-and-desktop-gif-makers/"><u>Exclusive List of Premium Online & Desktop GIF Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/youtube-treasures-the-ultimate-list-for-endless-screen-time/"><u>YouTube Treasures  The Ultimate List for Endless Screen Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/digital-footprint-how-to-share-your-short-videos-on-computers-and-phones-for-2024/"><u>Digital Footprint  How to Share Your Short Videos on Computers & Phones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/discover-10-amazing-world-wanderlust-channels/"><u>Discover 10 Amazing World Wanderlust Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/top-10-video-makers-choices-audio-enhancing-software/"><u>Top 10 Video Maker's Choices  Audio Enhancing Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/crafting-chic-looks-the-ultimate-cosmetic-compendium-for-2024/"><u>Crafting Chic Looks  The Ultimate Cosmetic Compendium for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/follow-the-flow-of-forum-fancies/"><u>Follow the Flow of Forum Fancies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-solutions-for-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Solutions For ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-strategic-podcast-drop-dates/"><u>2024 Approved  Strategic Podcast Drop Dates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expertly-selected-graphics-cards-for-peak-streaming-clarity/"><u>2024 Approved  Expertly Selected Graphics Cards for Peak Streaming Clarity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-convert-videos-to-gifs-with-ease-28-best-tools/"><u>In 2024, Convert Videos to GIFs with Ease 28 Best Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-rated-avi-editor-for-windows-8-advanced-video-editing-features/"><u>New 2024 Approved Top-Rated AVI Editor for Windows 8 Advanced Video Editing Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-becoming-a-conversational-maestro-harnessing-the-power-of-voxal-on-discord-for-2024/"><u>Updated Becoming a Conversational Maestro Harnessing the Power of Voxal on Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-teleport-your-gps-location-on-honor-90-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Teleport Your GPS Location On Honor 90? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-xiaomi-13t-pro-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Screen Mirroring Xiaomi 13T Pro to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Apart from making your YouTube video look organized and neat, chapters will let you provide a better user experience to everyone watching your video because they will find all the information about your video faster and easier within a video. And the second benefit is that your YouTube video will show up in search results. This is a way to optimize your content for more users to find your content.</p><p>YouTube chapters are beneficial for both creators and viewers. On the progress bar, these clickable chapters can be added. This will allow a viewer to skip and scrub through a video quickly and skip to parts they actually want to watch.</p><p>This feature is quite helpful for videos that are pretty long. Chapters will let you segment the videos into important chapters so that the viewer can rewatch already watched chapters or skip to other chapters in the video. YouTube chapters have been recently added to this platform for better navigation and engagement.</p><p><strong>Better User Experience for Users</strong></p><p>Just like Google wants browsers to find what they are looking for when they add a keyword, YouTube also wants to help viewers find what they are looking for. Chapters can be immensely beneficial for extended content. For example, if you are uploading a video of your convert video, let the users jump straight to their favorite songs.</p><p>Even in tutorial video content, viewers will now have a chance to get straight to the main part of the video. With chapters being added, viewers will have an opportunity to decide whether they want to watch the whole video or not. They won’t have to keep skipping one part to another blindly. Chapters will allow them to find what they are looking for in an instant.</p><p><strong>For Creators: Increased Visibility</strong></p><p>If you know about the Google algorithm, you must be aware that it regularly changes its algorithm to let people find the information they are looking for easily. Adding chapters to your video will encourage Google to display them more often when someone searches for them, and this will include adding your videos to its featured snippets.</p><p>While adding chapters, you need to make sure that it is labeled with correct keywords, and it is clear and descriptive. YouTube videos are often showed as Google snippet when someone tries to find something on the search engine. Adding a chapter will let Google understand the content better, thereby letting your videos gain more search traffic.</p><h2 id="Part-4-When-should-I-add-or-not-chapters-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-When-should-I-add-or-not-chapters-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: When should I add or not chapters on YouTube?"></a>Part 4: When should I add or not chapters on YouTube?</h2><p>If you are wondering whether all videos on YouTube should have chapters, the answer to this is no. A two minutes long video won’t require chapters because it won’t make sense. Think about whether you would want your audience to have reduced watch time. Another thing to pay attention to is audience retention.</p><p>We mentioned earlier that adding chapters to long videos will be a good idea, but before you jump in and start adding chapters, you need to understand whether it will help you and should be done in your particular case?</p><p>If you are uploading a video on education, science and technology, how-to, news and politics, Q and A, and other similar videos, adding chapters will definitely help. In these kinds of videos, you will let your audience rewatch a section they liked the most over and over again.</p><p>However, if you are uploading music, entertainment, comedy, and film and animation videos, we will recommend not to add chapters because this will reduce the watch time.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Do-YouTube-Video-Chapters-Decrease-Channel-Watch-Time"><a href="#Part-5-Do-YouTube-Video-Chapters-Decrease-Channel-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Do YouTube Video Chapters Decrease Channel Watch Time?"></a>Part 5: Do YouTube Video Chapters Decrease Channel Watch Time?</h2><p>One of the most commonly asked questions regarding adding chapters to YouTube videos is whether it will reduce the watch time of a video. Video chapters are a pretty good feature and can enable your videos to engage with the viewers.</p><p>Since chapters allow your audience to skip through video content, they are not really watching the whole video, which can’t be suitable for audience retention! Here’s what we have to say to this: don’t put your 100% focus on watch time right now. Your focus should be creating informative and engaging content, which will keep your audience hooked to their screens. Even if you add chapters, if your audience doesn’t find it engaging, they will choose not to go on with the content.</p><p>Video chapters are a tiny part of the overall content. Chapters provide value to your audience, and you should try them. If you are uploading a concise video, animation video, funny video, and more, don’t add chapters.</p><p>Even some of the most watched videos on YouTube have chapters. Learn from them. These video makers could have thought about numbers rather than giving value to their audience, but they did just the opposite, and here they are with over a million views!</p><h2 id="Part-6-Tips-for-adding-chapters-to-YouTube-video"><a href="#Part-6-Tips-for-adding-chapters-to-YouTube-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Tips for adding chapters to YouTube video"></a>Part 6: Tips for adding chapters to YouTube video</h2><p>Each video on YouTube is different, and that’s why there is no one-size-fits-all answer. There are some cases where you should not think about adding chapters at all. Whereas in other cases, you will have to experiment a bit before adding chapters.</p><p>Here are some tips that will help you.</p><p><strong>Do Some Testing</strong></p><p>Before adding chapters to a new video that you are thinking to upload, try adding chapters to an old video. See what happens to that video. Have the views increased? How about average view duration? Track these metrics first, and then try adding chapters to your upcoming videos to benefit from videos. Along with these metrics, you will also have to evaluate if adding chapters decreases or increases the watch time and number of views.</p><p><strong>Label Your Chapters Using Keywords</strong></p><p>Another thing to do that will help you have better traction is using a good keyword strategy. Look at what people are using while searching for content, which is similar to yours? Using names based on keywords that have better search volume will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Why-Video-Chapter-is-Not-working-Problem-solved"><a href="#Part-7-Why-Video-Chapter-is-Not-working-Problem-solved" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Why Video Chapter is Not working? [Problem solved]"></a>Part 7: Why Video Chapter is Not working? [Problem solved]</h2><p>There are a few mandatory things that you need to do before adding chapters to your YouTube video. Here are some of the common reasons why the video chapter is not working. See if any one of them is true in your case, and rectify it right away.</p><ul><li>Your video doesn’t have the 00:00 timestamp.</li><li>Your video has less than three chapters.</li><li>You have added a chapter that is less than 10 seconds long.</li><li>You have not added the timestamps in chronological order.</li><li>Rather than using “:” you have entered “.” for timecodes.</li><li>If your channel has active copyright strikes, video chapters won’t work.</li><li>Your channel doesn’t have more than 1k subscribers.</li><li>Your video chapters are not suitable for some viewers.</li></ul><p><img

You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p><p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p><h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p><p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p><p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p><p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p><p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p><p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p><h4 id="1-Give-Value"><a href="#1-Give-Value" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p><p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p><p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p><p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p><p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p><p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p><p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p><h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p><p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p><p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p><p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p><h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p><p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p><p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p><p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p><h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p><h4 id="1-Be-Original"><a href="#1-Be-Original" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p><p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p><p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p><p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p><h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p><p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p><p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p><p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p><h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p><p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p><p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p><p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p><p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p><p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p><p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p><h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p><h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p><p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p><h4 id="2-Reviews"><a href="#2-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p><h4 id="3-Walkthrough"><a href="#3-Walkthrough" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p><h4 id="4-Reactions"><a href="#4-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p><h4 id="5-Skills"><a href="#5-Skills" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p><h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p><p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p><p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p><p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p><p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p><p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p><p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p><p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p><p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p><p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p><p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p><p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p><p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p><p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p><h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p><p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p><h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p><p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p><p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p><h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p><p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p><h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p><p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p><p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"                      alt="Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"                ></p><p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p><p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"                      alt="Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"                ></p><p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p><p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p><p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p><p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p><p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p><p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p><h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p><p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p><ol><li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li><li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li></ol><p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-awesome-thumbnail-youtube-gaming-1.jpg"                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"                ></p><ol><li>Don’t want to use your face?

Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p><p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p><p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="6.

Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p><p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p><p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p><p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p><p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p><h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p><p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p><p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p><p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p><p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p><p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p><p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p><p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p><p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol><li>Don’t go into YouTube gaming for the money, but rather to improve your skills and other people’s lives.</li><li>Find something special about your channel that people can’t find anywhere else.</li><li>YouTube gaming can be as cheap and as expensive as you want, create a budget to stay within your limits.</li><li>Understand optimization to improve your chances of viewers finding your content.</li><li>Don’t be hateful or advertisers will avoid you, and don’t steal other people’s content without crediting the original creator.</li><li>Give yourself a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >unique YouTube gaming channel name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ol><p><em>What’s stopping you from starting your YouTube gaming channel?

What kind of game capture gear you need will depend on what kind of game you are playing.</p><p>For recording games on your computer screen, you may only need software, and there are a few quality game recording software out there for free. One popular option among YouTube gamers is called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or ‘Open Broadcaster Software’. OBS is free to download from Obsproject.com. The thing that makes it great for gamers is it can be used for live streaming to YouTube, or other sharing sites like Twitch.tv (which has a focus on gaming videos).</p><p>For those who want to record the gameplay with ease and edit the recorded gameplay footage with the same tool, we recommend you to try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a 2-in-1 gameplay recording software and video editor on both Windows and Mac.</p><p>The advantages of using Filmora to record YouTube Gameplay video:</p><ul><li>Record 4K gameplay and high-space game</li><li>Record gameplay and webcam at the same time</li><li>Mark the important moment with the Marker feature when playing the game</li><li>Basic video editing tools provide trimming, cutting, and merging features as well as annotation effects</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>If you are going to be making videos more related to consol games then you may need to invest in a Capture device. One of the best is the Elgato Game Capture HD60 featured above. It captures video directly onto either your Mac or PC, while a lot of the other top capture devices only work with a PC. It can record in 1080p with 60fps, and you can even live stream. The Elgato HD60 is compatible with PS4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and the Wii U.</p><h4 id="2-Audio-Recording-Devices"><a href="#2-Audio-Recording-Devices" class="headerlink" title="2.

The thing that will set you apart from other people posting gaming commentary is your personality, and that will only come across if your videos have clear audio. It does not do you much good to be hilarious in a fuzzy commentary track.</p><p>A lot of YouTube gamers, especially gamers who are just starting to make videos, go with the Zalman ZM-Mic1 which can be used in combination with headphones. The Zalman might pick up background sounds, like mouse clicks, which is not ideal. However, it will give you significantly better audio than recording directly from your computer, and at under $10 it will not be a purchase you regret. The Zalman is a great starter-mic, especially if you download the free audio editing program Audacity and use it to clean up the little imperfections in your recording. Audacity can be downloaded at Audacityteam.org.</p><p>If you are looking for more control over your recording then you should consider the Blue Yeti Mic, which is featured above. This standalone mic is also used by a lot of vloggers and YouTube gamers. It has volume control and even a mute button. It plugs right into the USB drive of your computer using a ten-foot cable, which means you can take it pretty far from your computer. The Blue Yeti USB mic costs about $130.</p><p>Check our best list of audio recording devices: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphones for YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Video-Recording-Devices"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-Devices" class="headerlink" title="3.

Rather than buying a $1000 DSLR for reaction shots, you should go with a reliable webcam. Before you make a decision about what kind of webcam to get consider how often you will be using your facecam. Not all gaming videos need one. If you play a lot of survival horror games then your reactions will be a key element in your videos, but if you are not playing games that will cause you to have amusing reactions then a facecam will not really add anything to a viewer’s experience.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use DSLR as a webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If your facecam is going to be an important element in your channel then you should expect to spend around $100 on your webcam. The above image is the Logitech C920, which is one of the best at this price point. It performs well in low light, has a good auto-focus feature, and the quality of its video recordings is quite high.</p><p>If you are only going to use a facecam occasionally then consider the Genius WideCam F100, which can be found online for around $30. Its 1080p HD recordings are not as smooth as they should be, but it performs very well at 720p and that is all you should need.</p><p>Check more options for the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best webcams for YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Once you have these gaming recording devices, you can now go to record a gameplay and upload it to YouTube.

It can come down to picking a topic that’s trending.</p><p>A trending topic is a subject which a lot of people are currently interested in. If you learn how to tap into what’s popular and cover it in creative and innovative ways then that will help your channel grow more quickly. You’ll get more views, more subscribers, and higher search rankings by following these simple tips.</p><ol><li><strong><a href="#relevant">Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#niche">Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#aim">Aim for Number 1</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#viral">Success Doesn’t Mean Making a Viral Video</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#snowball">The Subscriber Snowball Effect</a></strong></li></ol><p><a href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=get_subs_evergreen&utm_content=blog%202"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers-download-btn.png"                      alt="guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers"                ></a></p><h2 id="1-Think-of-‘Trending’-as-Relevant"><a href="#1-Think-of-‘Trending’-as-Relevant" class="headerlink" title="1. Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant"></a><strong>1. Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant</strong></h2><p>Instead of thinking of a trending video as a video that everyone is doing, think of it as a subject that is relevant to a lot of people. You want to cover topics that a lot of people care about.</p><p>A lot of YouTubers see huge channels have a lot of success posting videos that are very focused on the personal life of the creator (i.e. ‘I had the WORST day’) or which have very vague or sensational titles (i.e. ‘The horse knows what it did’) and decide that those are the kinds of videos they want to do too. However, the only reason large channels are able to be successful with these kinds of videos and titles is that they are already big. These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.</p><p>As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting. The content might be good, but it won’t help you grow.</p><h2 id="2-Find-Trending-Topics-Within-Your-Niche"><a href="#2-Find-Trending-Topics-Within-Your-Niche" class="headerlink" title="2. Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche"></a><strong>2. Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche</strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/niche-find-your-niche.jpg"                      alt="find your niche"                ></strong></p><p>Taking on trending topics shouldn’t mean taking on topics you aren’t actually interested in or don’t care about. Every genre on YouTube has its own trends, and you will often know about them just by virtue of watching other channels in your genre and talking to people who are interested in the same things as you. For example, if you’re a Gamer and your friends are also Gamers then you probably already know what Gamers are currently interested in.</p><p>If you do need help determining trends, here are 2 ways to do it:</p><ol><li>Visit 3 of the most popular channels in your genre (i.e. gaming, beauty, or prank) and see if there’s any overlap in the themes of their most recent videos.</li><li>Go to <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.ca/trends/" >Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and look at the categories most relevant to your genre. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >To learn how to use Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ol><h2 id="3-Aim-for-Number-1"><a href="#3-Aim-for-Number-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Aim for Number 1"></a><strong>3. Aim for Number 1</strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-in-divergent-way.jpg"                      alt="think-in-divergent-way"                ></strong></p><p>Being trendy doesn’t mean you can’t be original. If you know what’s popular in your genre then that will enable you to ask yourself ‘what’s on-trend, but not being covered yet?’.</p><p>For example, if you know that relationship videos – topics like ‘how do you know a guy likes you?’ – are doing well then you can think about what other aspects of dating people might be interested in that don’t have many videos on them yet. If you’re one of the first to tackle something that’s on-trend you have a much better chance of getting that number 1 search engine ranking, and higher ranked videos always get more views.</p><h2 id="4-Success-Doesn’t-Mean-Making-a-Viral-Video"><a href="#4-Success-Doesn’t-Mean-Making-a-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Success Doesn’t Mean Making a Viral Video"></a><strong>4. Success Doesn’t Mean Making a Viral Video</strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viral-video.png"                      alt="viral-video"                ></strong></p><p>There’s a common misconception that in order to grow your channel you need to make your videos go viral. The truth is that having one or two viral videos probably won’t help you much. People don’t subscribe to one video, they subscribe for consistently good content.</p><p>It’s much better to have 10 videos on a popular topic that are doing alright than it is to have that one big viral hit. Those 10 videos will consistently bring in new viewers to your channel who are more likely to subscribe because they can see you have other content they’re interested in.</p><h2 id="5-The-Subscriber-Snowball-Effect"><a href="#5-The-Subscriber-Snowball-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. The Subscriber Snowball Effect"></a><strong>5. The Subscriber Snowball Effect</strong></h2><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snowball-effect.jpg"                      alt="snowball-effect"                ></strong></p><p>When you make multiple videos around a trending topic, they’re more likely to come up as ‘related’ to each other than if you only cover the topic in one video. If someone enjoys one of your videos on that topic and can see there’s another right there in the related videos, there’s a good chance they’ll click on it.</p><p>This gets you more views on multiple videos, and more subscribers because it builds the expectation that you’re going to continue to keep covering relevant topics. Having viewers click from video to video on your channel also increases your watch time, which YouTube’s algorithm takes as a sign that they should rank your videos higher in search results (getting you even more views).</p><p>Do you have any of your own tips for how to get a YouTube video trending?</p><p>Finding the trend is integral for YouTube channel growth.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enhance-Interaction-Share-Your-Custom-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#Enhance-Interaction-Share-Your-Custom-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="Enhance Interaction: Share Your Custom YouTube Playlist"></a>Enhance Interaction: Share Your Custom YouTube Playlist</h2><p>YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

Programs like <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are popular for this purpose, as it offers a wide range of tools and features for editing and resizing images.</p><p>This program allows you to import an image, resize it to the dimensions required for a YouTube thumbnail (typically 1280 x 720 pixels), and save the edited version to your desired location. Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Open</strong>,” then search for the file you want to resize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp open thumbnail"                ></p><p>Step3 Click on “<strong>Image</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Scale Image</strong>“ and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG"                      alt="gimp edit resolution"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Export As</strong>“ and <strong>toggle</strong> the “<strong>Select File Type (By Extension)</strong>“ option. <strong>Choose</strong> JPG&#x2F;JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-format.JPG"                      alt="gimp export format"                ></p><p>Step5 You can change the quality of the image and <strong>click</strong> the “<strong>Export</strong>“ button to save the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp export thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1"><a href="#Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods"></a>Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods</h2><p>Now that we’ve explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it’s time to compare the pros and cons of each method. In this section, we’ll consider factors such as ease of use, speed, quality, cost, and compatibility to help you determine the best option for your needs.</p><p>Take a look at the table below for a more detailed comparison.</p><p>| |  <strong>Windows Default App</strong>                         | <strong>Online YouTube Thumbnail Size Converter</strong> | <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> | <strong>Third-Party Software</strong> |          |<br>| ————————————————– | ——————————————- | ———————– | ———————— | ——– |<br>| <strong>Other Software Required or Not</strong>                 | No                                          | Yes (Internet Browser)  | Yes                      | Yes      |<br>| <strong>Internet Connection Required</strong>                   | No                                          | Yes                     | No                       | No       |<br>| <strong>Complexity of Operations</strong>                       | Easy                                        | Easy                    | Easy                     | Moderate |<br>| <strong>Support Other Editing of the YouTube Thumbnail</strong> | No                                          | No                      | Yes                      | Yes      |<br>| <strong>File Size Limit</strong>                                | None                                        | 25MB                    | None                     | None     |</p><p>Resizing YouTube thumbnails using the Windows default app is a quick and easy method that requires no additional software or tools. However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP. Each method has advantages and disadvantages; the best one depends on your specific needs and preferences.

Let’s start by taking a look at the best YouTube keyword tools available.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-autocomplete"><a href="#1-YouTube-autocomplete" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube autocomplete"></a>1. YouTube autocomplete</h4><p>When you start to search for something on YouTube, you’ll probably notice that YouTube suggests some keywords to finish your search. This is called autocomplete, and it works by suggesting the most popular keywords that start with the letters you’ve typed so far. What it is essentially saying is that those are the most frequently searched for terms that use the words you’ve already typed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-complete.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>This means it’s a great place to start building your keywords, and a fantastic YouTube keyword tool for your videos. Just start your search for your video (e.g. shoes for…) and see what comes up. In this case, we can see that the most popular keywords are ‘girls’, ‘men’, ‘kids’, ‘summer’ and ‘boys’.</p><h4 id="2-Keywordtool-io"><a href="#2-Keywordtool-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Keywordtool.io"></a>2. Keywordtool.io</h4><p>Without doubt, this is one of the most powerful YouTube keyword tools out there, ranking hundreds of keywords by popularity. It captures data from YouTube autocomplete and allows you to create lists of keywords from that data. As well as autocompete data, you can also search for questions people are asking, which makes it highly beneficial as a YouTube SEO tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>The downside to this particular tool is that it’s fairly limited on the free version. Upgrading to Pro Basic will give you almost double the keyword results and will let you compare the volume of searches made for those terms too. However, this will set you back around $68 a year, so it’s going to be something of an investment if you go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io-result.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><h4 id="3-SEOChat"><a href="#3-SEOChat" class="headerlink" title="3. SEOChat"></a>3. SEOChat</h4><p>SEO Chat is an amazing free tool that can generate keyword ideas from Google, Amazon, Bing and YouTube. You can search for keywords from all of those sources or can just search YouTube alone to find your keyword lists. You’ll need a ‘seed’ keyword, such as ‘shoes’, ‘make up’ or ‘marketing’, and then organizes results alphabetically with other letters following your seed keyword.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seochat-youtube.jpg"                      alt="SEOChat youtube keyword tool SEOChat"                ></p><p>Simply scrolling through the results is going to give you loads of ideas for keywords and possibly content too. The tool also allows you to further expand your results by selecting a keyword and running ‘part two’ of the process, which expands those phrases even further. Your chosen keywords can be exported from the software, ready for use in your YouTube SEO tool.</p><h4 id="4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor"><a href="#4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor" class="headerlink" title="4. Gather keywords from your competitor"></a>4. Gather keywords from your competitor</h4><p>Why not learn from the best and see what’s already working for your competitors? Finding their high traffic keywords is easy and can save a lot of time and energy. To do this, pick a channel that is around your size, as they’re your nearest competitors. Steer clear of the huge channels, as you’ll find it hard to rank next to them.</p><p>Click the videos tab to see their content, and sort them by ‘most popular’ to see the ones which got the most views. Take a look at the <strong>title</strong> and the <strong>description</strong> of those videos, and you’ll find a good fistful of proven keywords that you can start using yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/most-popular-video-youtube-channel.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>That’s not all though. To maximize your competitor research, let’s dig a little deeper into the <strong>tags</strong> they have used for their videos too. Unfortunately, these are hidden on YouTube, but are easily seen using the page’s HTML. Simply right click on the page and select ‘view source’. Don’t be alarmed at the great stream of HTML that pops up, it’s easy to search using your search function (press ctrl + f on Windows or ⌘ + f on iOS) by typing in ‘keywords’ to the search box. The following terms are the tags used in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-keywords-youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>If ploughing through HTML sounds somewhat taxing, there is a handy YouTube SEO tool you can use to display the tags on page. It’s called <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy-for-youtube/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and is a Chrome extension which you’ll find in the Chrome store for free.</p><h4 id="5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator"><a href="#5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator" class="headerlink" title="5. Keyword Tool Dominator"></a>5. Keyword Tool Dominator</h4><p>It’s got a grand name, but it’s actually really easy to use and a great place to start if you’re new to YouTube keyword research. Pop in your seed keywords and the Dominator will produce a list of relevant keywords related to those terms. You can then select the most useful and download them to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Keyword-tool-dominator.jpg"                      alt="tool for youtube keyword"                ></p><p>The drawback with this is that you can only perform three searches a day on the free version. Perhaps that’s enough for you to begin with, but if you want to upgrade to the unlimited version, which will also give you search volumes, it’s a one-off fee of $39.99.</p><h4 id="6-Ubersuggest"><a href="#6-Ubersuggest" class="headerlink" title="6. Ubersuggest"></a>6. Ubersuggest</h4><p>For getting more data on specific keywords, Ubersuggest from the SEO guru that is Neil Patel is one of the best tools out there. As well as showing search volume and competition, you can see other information such as cost per click and the seasonality of the keyword. It’s free to use with no limitations at all, so is well worth checking out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ubersuggest-youtube-keywords.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="7-Google-trends"><a href="#7-Google-trends" class="headerlink" title="7. Google trends"></a>7. Google trends</h4><p>We would highly recommend investigating Google Trends as part of your YouTube keyword research, as it is powerful, accurate and, best of all, free! The options let you narrow down the trend results to just YouTube searches, which is great for gaining insights to your search terms. You can narrow down the results to a specific country too, helping you to gain insight into what your target demographic is currently interested in.</p><h4 id="8-VidIQ"><a href="#8-VidIQ" class="headerlink" title="8. VidIQ"></a>8. VidIQ</h4><p>The keyword tool in VidIQ is one of very few research tools that has a function for just YouTube built in. You can paste in the keywords you want to research, choose the country you wish to target, and it will return all the search volumes and amount of competition, and will score your keywords based on these figures.</p><p>On the downside, there is a fairly complicated subscription process to go through if you want to upgrade from the free version. To be honest, the free version is OK for new users, but for in depth analytics you’re going to want to upgrade eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-vidiq.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool VidIQ"                ></p><h4 id="9-Keyword-Keg"><a href="#9-Keyword-Keg" class="headerlink" title="9. Keyword Keg"></a>9. Keyword Keg</h4><p>Keyword Keg is definitely one of the most powerful YouTube keyword research tools out there. It offers lots of data, drawn from a variety of data sources including Wikipedia, Alibaba, Playstore and more. There are filters for country and language and you can drill down into issues like buyer intent and product info. However, as with most free YouTube keyword tools, there is a strict limit on what you can do before you pay. In this case, you only get to see the first five results unless you want to upgrade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-keywordkeg.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="10-Kparser"><a href="#10-Kparser" class="headerlink" title="10. Kparser"></a>10. Kparser</h4><p>Kparser is a YouTube keyword tool that you should notice. You can use it to find YouTube keywords free to use. More than finding the best core keywords, this tool can also give you suggestions on long tail keywords in every field. By use this, you don’t need to worry that you can’t the right keywords to use in title, description and tags. You also can selcet country and language when searching a YouTube keyword. For searching more than one keyword, remember to seperate them with coma.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/kparser.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool Kparser"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords"><a href="#Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords"></a>Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords</h3><p>Getting your video ranking highly on YouTube is excellent and will certainly bring you more traffic. But, do you know what would be even better than that? Getting your video ranking on Google as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-video-result-keywords.jpg"                      alt="Google video result keywords"                ></p><p>To do this you’ll need to find ‘video result keywords’ in Google, so that yours can be one of the selected videos that sometimes show up in search. Google decides what should and shouldn’t trigger a video result, and usually shows them when a video would make sense, for example when someone asks ‘how to’ or searches for ‘cute’ or ‘funny’ things.</p><p>There’s a bit of trial and error involved as there is no YouTube keyword tool to find video result keywords… yet. But you can use Google to search your keywords and see if they are video result keywords. Just type them in, and if a video appears in the listings below, you’ve discovered a video result keyword that is well worth optimizing for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/navigating-the-nuances-of-gamers-channel-templates/"><u>Navigating the Nuances of Gamers' Channel Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/exploring-youtubes-strategy-for-video-short-promotion/"><u>Exploring YouTube's Strategy for Video Short Promotion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/channel-boosting-mastery-unveiling-the-best-5-video-marketing-strategies-for-2024/"><u>Channel Boosting Mastery  Unveiling the Best 5 Video Marketing Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/best-10-free-youtube-subtitle-extractors-and-downloaders-for-2024/"><u>Best 10 Free YouTube Subtitle Extractors & Downloaders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/revolutionize-your-content-with-youtube-split-screen-videos/"><u>Revolutionize Your Content with YouTube Split-Screen Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/youtube-collaboration-guide-to-find-partners-and-make-collab-videos/"><u>YouTube Collaboration Guide to Find Partners and Make Collab Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-attract-more-viewers-boosting-your-youtube-following/"><u>In 2024, Attract More Viewers  Boosting Your YouTube Following</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/things-you-dont-know-about-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-reset-code-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Things You Dont Know About Samsung Galaxy A15 4G Reset Code | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-video-mastery-on-linkedin-the-perfect-aspect-ratio-guide/"><u>New In 2024, Video Mastery on LinkedIn The Perfect Aspect Ratio Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Spotify Keeps Crashing A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Motorola Moto G24 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-screen-ready-images-opting-for-srgb/"><u>In 2024, Screen Ready Images  Opting for Srgb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-realme-c55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Tutorial to Use VPNa to Fake GPS Location On Realme C55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-step-by-step-approach-for-flawless-instagrams/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Step-by-Step Approach for Flawless Instagrams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flamegrab-firefox-add-ons/"><u>2024 Approved  FlameGrab Firefox Add-Ons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-rapid-fortnite-tile-making-hacks/"><u>[New] Rapid Fortnite Tile-Making Hacks</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

From there, click into the Analytics tab in the menu on the left of your screen.</p><p>In order to check which of your videos are performing the best, click on <strong>Watch time</strong> under <strong>Watch time reports</strong>. At the top of the page there’ll be a graph of your watch time in general, and if you scroll down you’ll see a list of your videos ranked by watch time. The best performing ones will be at the top and, to see more stats related to these high-performing videos, simply click on their titles. Afterwards, you’ll be able to click around the different sections in your Analytics and see reports relating to the specific video you clicked on.</p><p>The two main types of analytics reports are Watch Time Reports and Interaction Reports.</p><h3 id="1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports"><a href="#1-Interpreting-YouTube-Watch-Time-Reports" class="headerlink" title="1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports"></a>1. Interpreting YouTube Watch Time Reports</h3><p>To find <strong>Watch time reports</strong> you just need to log into your Google account, go to the <strong>Creator studio</strong>, click the analytics tab, and then click on <strong>watch time</strong>. You can see the watch time of every video on your channel, which is important data to have because watch time is the most important factor when it comes to ranking your video in search results.</p><p>A watch time report includes the total amount of time that your video, or a selection of videos, is actually being watched for. In order to make sure that you are publishing only quality videos you need to make sure that your viewers are consistently sticking to your videos and watching them all away through, or at least to the half-way mark. Watch time represents one of the most meaningful metrics in ensuring that you are engaging your audience.</p><p>YouTube analytics can now display a watch time of every video that you have produced. Seeing the metrics on how long people are actually watching every video that you produce can show you what you’ve done right in the past and what you need to do more of to continue raising your watch time.</p><p>Alongside watch time you can see the average duration individual viewers are watching your videos for. The average percentage of your video that gets viewed will showcase areas where you may be struggling with your video content. For example, if an abnormally high number of viewers are clicking away during your intro, there’s probably something about that clip that needs to be changed.</p><p>In the watch time reports for individual videos, you will be able to see data on where your views are coming from and which demographics are watching the most. Where your viewers are watching, in terms of desktop or mobile, is also interesting data that is available in this section.</p><p>Click here for more tips on<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/12-proven-ways-to-increase-youtube-views-315.html" >increasing your views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports"><a href="#2-Interpreting-YouTube-Interaction-Reports" class="headerlink" title="2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports"></a>2. Interpreting YouTube Interaction Reports</h3><p>Interaction reports are related to the actions viewers take – i.e. subscribing to your channel, liking your videos, or leaving a comments. You can find interaction reports in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics</strong>.</p><p>Interaction reports can be broken down into several different reports that can help determine the overall performance of any YouTube videos. The main interaction reports that you should be interested in include:</p><p><strong>1. Subscribers:</strong> You can find extensive data on your subscribers, like demographics including age groups and gender. Learning more about your subscribers can help you to tailor your content. For example, if you learn that your viewers are mostly young women under 24 in the USA, you can do research into what is currently popular with young women under 24 in the USA.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to see your subscriber count in real-time? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>2. Likes and dislikes:</strong> Likes and dislikes aren’t a powerful metric when it comes to search engine rankings, but they provide useful information to creators. If you’re getting a lot of dislikes on a video, you should look into why. If you’re getting a lot of likes on a video, it can indicate that you should focus on creating similar content.</p><p><strong>3. Playlists:</strong> A viewer watching a video in a playlist is much more likely to keep watching more videos from that playlist, making playlists great for the growth of your channel. Reports in this section will help you figure out which of your playlists is performing best, which could give you an idea of which types of videos or video topics are going over best with your viewers.</p><p><strong>4. Comments:</strong> Reading comments is a great way to figure out what your viewers think, but that’s not all they’re good for. If viewers return to a video to continue talking to you or other viewers then that will drive up your views and watch time. If a video is especially good at generating discussion, you should figure out why (i.e. your sign-off question) and keep doing it.</p><p><strong>5. Sharing:</strong> Discovering where your video is being shared can be important for figuring out what platforms you should be on besides YouTube. If your video is shared and viewed a lot on Twitter, you should consider making a Twitter account for your channel.</p><p><strong>6. Cards:</strong> Tracking the performance of your Cards will help you optimize them to direct traffic between your videos. By testing out different time stamps for cards you’ll find the perfect places to put them. By trying different messages in your cards you’ll learn how to write ‘calls to action’ that mobilize your viewers.</p><p><strong>End screens:</strong> End Screens are essential for keeping viewers on your channel. The report of the click-through rates of your end screens is important for helping you figure out which kinds of links work, and which style of ends screen is most effective for you. Are people more likely to click when you talk to them through the end screen, or when it’s a static card?</p><p><strong>7. 360 heat map reports:</strong> A heat map report works specifically with 360° videos if you are choosing to engage your audience with this type of content. Viewing YouTube video statistics for 360° heat maps will help to show the areas on your video that viewers are most interested in.</p><h2 id="How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics"><a href="#How-to-View-Other-Peoples-YouTube-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics"></a>How to View Other Peoples YouTube Statistics</h2><p>If you want to check out the statistics of rival YouTube channels (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-chart---the-5-most-subscribed-youtube-channels-320.html" >including the most subscribed channels on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), or channels you’re a fan of, try using <a class="link"   href="http://www.socialblade.com/" >Social Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There are plenty of simple and completely free ways that you can gain more YouTube views and consistently see more traffic on every video that you produce.</p><p>Here are the top 12 ways that you can increase YouTube views on your videos:</p><ol><li><strong><a href="#one">Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#two">Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#three">Be a Part of the Community</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#four">Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#five">Optimizing Your Content for Keywords</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#six">Use Keywords in Your Video File Names</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#seven">Write Titles That Are Click-Worthy</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#eight">Use Lots of Tags</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#nine">Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#ten">Learn from the Success of Your Best Performing Videos</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#eleven">Embed Videos in Your Blog&#x2F;Website</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#twelve">Share Your Videos on Social Media</a></strong></li></ol><h2 id="1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists"><a href="#1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists"></a><strong>1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</strong></h2><p>YouTube playlists are an excellent way to chain together your video content and organize your channel, which will both translate into more views.</p><p>A quality playlist groups together several videos that are in some way similar. Think about the different ways you could sort your videos – by topic, by type, etc. – and make as many playlists as you can come up with. You can even reuse the same videos on multiple playlists where it makes sense. After you’re done, viewers who want to see all of you Call of Duty Let’s Plays or all of your makeup pallet reviews will be able to find them easily and will spend much more time watching your videos.</p><p>By creating a themed playlist of videos that will play one after another you increase the chances of your viewers sticking around to watch multiple videos. Making playlists helps you direct traffic from your more popular videos to the ones that haven’t gotten as many views, and it also helps drive up your watch time. Watch time is an important metric for YouTube’s search engine. When you increase your watch time, you can rank higher in search results and even get more views on YouTube.</p><h2 id="2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails"></a><strong>2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >High-quality video thumbnails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> play a major role in getting views for your YouTube videos. Spending a bit of time in Photoshop or a free online program like Canva on custom thumbnails for every video will help to boost YouTube views and earn you more clicks.</p><p>By having specialty thumbnails you will also have another type of content that is indexed by search engines. Every video you post will be searchable by not only text (your description) and video searches, but by image searches as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For a list of YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community"><a href="#3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="3. Be a Part of the Community"></a><strong>3. Be a Part of the Community</strong></h2><p>Regularly viewing videos from other channels within your genre, especially channels about the same size as yours, and taking the time to leave thoughtful comments can help to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >build your presence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within the online community. Other creators will notice you as you become a regular viewer and this will lead to them going to your channel and watching your videos (without you having to ask!).</p><p>You might even be able to create opportunities to collaborate with other creators by first becoming a fan of theirs. Collaboration videos allow you to cross-promote your content and attract new viewers and subscribers.</p><h2 id="4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends"><a href="#4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends"></a><strong>4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends</strong></h2><p>New <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >trends are important to jump on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially when other YouTube creators are having success with videos on a particular set of trends. If there is a worldwide issue going on, a new and popular game, or a meme that everyone is making jokes about, you should consider making your own type of video related to that trend. Trending content almost always earns plenty of views because people search out content related to the trend they’re interested in. Covering a trend can bring in a whole new audience for your channel.</p><p>You can find trending topics to make videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or by checking out the popular channels in your genre to see if there’s a trend they’re all jumping on. When you cover a trend, always try to bring in your own original spin to stand out from the multitude of other videos covering the same trend.</p><h2 id="5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords"><a href="#5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords"></a><strong>5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords</strong></h2><p>Every piece of content that you produce for YouTube needs to be appropriately optimized with keywords. This means writing a full description that includes your 3 most important keywords in your first 3 lines, including a large number of appropriate tags and using your most important keyword in your title.</p><p>Do some keyword research to figure out what viewers who might enjoy your video will be typing into the search bar. You can start by searching for the topic of your video (i.e. ‘iPhone X review) and seeing what kinds of words are used in the titles and descriptions of the highest-ranked videos (or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You can even see the tags of other people’s videos using a free Chrome extension called VidIQ.</p><h2 id="6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names"><a href="#6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names"></a><strong>6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names</strong></h2><p>A commonly overlooked area for optimization is the file names of YouTube videos. Many YouTube creators simply have generic filenames for all of the videos that they upload on the platform, such as ‘youtubevideo54.mp4’. Saving your files with names like this is actually a huge missed opportunity.</p><p>Consider renaming your video file to reflect your keyword-optimized video title. Including keywords within your file names will make sure that even the file itself will be indexed properly in a Google video search. This is a very quick, easy, way to increase your search ranking and get more views on YouTube.</p><h2 id="7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy"><a href="#7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy" class="headerlink" title="7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy"></a><strong>7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy</strong></h2><p>A title on a YouTube video needs to work just as effectively as any other headline on the internet. You need to be able to capture the attention of your audience and generate excitement while still using important keywords and letting your viewers know exactly what your video is about. Mysterious clickbait titles only work for channels that are already big.</p><p>Having the ability to write excellent titles that also carry keyword information that is relevant to your niche will take practice. In order for a title to be click-worthy, it needs to demonstrate a clear benefit for the viewer. A ‘clear benefit’ might be a skill the viewer will learn or information they will gain. Creating a sense of urgency in the title will also help to attract more clicks, and that can be done by using words like ‘now’ or ‘today’.</p><h2 id="8-Use-Lots-of-Tags"><a href="#8-Use-Lots-of-Tags" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Lots of Tags"></a><strong>8. Use Lots of Tags</strong></h2><p>Every YouTube user is limited to 426 characters for the total number of tags that they can include, and you should try to use as much of that space as you can. The more tags you use, the more potential searches YouTube might add your video to.</p><p>It’s important to have high converting tags that will generate a fair amount of viewership. By trying out a wide variety of tags related to your videos in the early days of your YouTube channel you will start to see which perform the best for you. You can then start making videos that target those tags in a more focused manner. As you start to do research into keywords and the types of tags that work best for your channel, you can eventually zero in on some of the best tags that you can use with all of your content moving forward.</p><h2 id="9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content"><a href="#9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content"></a><strong>9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</strong></h2><p>The description that you post alongside your video is often one of the greatest ways that you can index your video in search engine results. Video content is starting to gain an extensive amount of traction especially when it comes to the way that it’s indexed in Google’s video search engine results. In order for your YouTube video to rank well within the search engine results, you need to have a thorough description.</p><p>A thorough description means doing keyword research as well as using the maximum number of characters that you can for the description. The largest YouTube descriptions that you might see are around 900 words. That means plenty of opportunities to use keywords within the content and help index the page in search engine results. Google will index the entire description just as it would any other webpage content so including a full transcription of your video or a detailed description of the content that’s in your video will help you to capture a huge audience and increase your YouTube views.</p><h2 id="10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos"><a href="#10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos"></a><strong>10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Checking the analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your channel regularly is important for creators both big and small. The analytics in your Creator Studio can tell you who’s watching your videos, which videos have the best watch time, and even which videos attract the newest subscribers.</p><p>When you know which videos are the most successful at getting people to subscribe, you can figure out why (perhaps it was the way you asked?) and replicate that method in your future videos. This will earn you more views over time because subscribers will watch more of your content.</p><p>You should also try to replicate the methods you used to get higher watch times in the videos that perform well in that regard. Improving your watch time will get you higher search engine rankings and more views.</p><h2 id="11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website"><a href="#11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website" class="headerlink" title="11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website"></a><strong>11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website</strong></h2><p>Starting your own personal blog or website and embedding your videos within text posts is a great way to get more views. Views gathered outside of YouTube count too, and creating a web page means that there’s one more way for people to find your content in their search results.</p><p>If you do not have a blog and do not want to start one, consider whether you can get your videos embedded on someone else’s website or blog. It’s easiest to ask a friend, but you could also try to reach out to a blogger in your niche who doesn’t have their own YouTube channel. Explain that having a video embedded in their post might be useful for their readers, and can help to boost their session time which will be good for their search engine rankings.</p><h2 id="12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media"><a href="#12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="12. Share your Videos on Social Media"></a><strong>12. Share your Videos on Social Media</strong></h2><p>The YouTube community is quite a large one on its own but it doesn’t hurt to extend your social reach by <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >starting social media pages for your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well. Having an official Twitter or Instagram that is connected to your YouTube account can really help you to share your videos with a wider audience and ensure that you can capture views from many different sources at once.</p><p>Social media accounts also help you hold your subscribers’ attention across multiple platforms. Make sure you’re providing some additional value on social media and not just posting links to your videos (i.e. behind the scenes photos).</p><p>Building up social media pages will give you plenty of new search engine results with indexed content as well.</p><p>Most successful YouTube creators also have links to their social media accounts all across their channel banner and they regularly share their videos as soon as they are posted over their social media accounts so that their followers share their video too.</p><p>You should sign up for every social media platform you can think of with your channel name, just so that nobody else can use it, but you only need to actively use the platforms that are relevant to your audience. For example, lifestyle YouTubers should be on Instagram but gamers don’t need to be.</p><p> These are all <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >methods that anyone can use for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Seeing improvements with your YouTube channel isn’t necessarily something that happens overnight but with dedicated work and marketing, you can start to see your channel grow. Consider using some of these strategies to <strong>increase YouTube views.</strong></p><p>Also want to create an attractive YouTube video?

Because YouTube algorithms prefer to highlight YouTube videos that contain closed captions because such content appears universally acceptable and it helps to boost the experience for viewers. So when your YouTube video has some kind of relevant audio or speech information then it is essential to add closed captions (YouTube CC) to it.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-Having-YouTube-CC-Always-On"><a href="#Benefits-of-Having-YouTube-CC-Always-On" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Having YouTube CC Always On"></a><strong>Benefits of Having YouTube CC Always On</strong></h2><p>YouTube CC can easily bring more viewers to your terminal. But not all users know how to turn it on or bother to turn it on when it can actually help improve the watching experience. So there are few benefits that you can enjoy by having CCs ALWAYS on your videos.</p><p>- Closed captions play an important role when you have poor audio quality in your videos. For instance, if your videos did not follow the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best audio recording practices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and are affected by background noise or bad audio equipment. In such cases, YouTube subtitles help viewers to understand what is going on videos even if they cannot hear it.</p><p>- For those who make videos with a unique accent, discuss something complex, or speaks too fast, turning on the closed captions help your viewers understand explanations and maintain their attention.</p><p>- This feature makes videos more accessible and can also appear useful for viewers that are hearing impaired.</p><h2 id="How-to-Force-YouTube-CC-to-Always-Turn-On"><a href="#How-to-Force-YouTube-CC-to-Always-Turn-On" class="headerlink" title="How to Force YouTube CC to Always Turn On?"></a><strong>How to Force YouTube CC to Always Turn On?</strong></h2><p>So, as you have gone through several benefits associated with YouTube video closed captions, now it is time to learn the technique to keep them always On.</p><h4 id="Go-through-the-steps-below-to-force-CCs-always-on-your-YouTube-videos"><a href="#Go-through-the-steps-below-to-force-CCs-always-on-your-YouTube-videos" class="headerlink" title="Go through the steps below to force CCs always on your YouTube videos:"></a><strong>Go through the steps below to force CCs always on your YouTube videos:</strong></h4><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Login and click the video in which you wish to add your captions.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Click Edit underneath the video</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-edit-video1.png"                      alt="click edit video"                ></p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Add a specific tag to your content: “yt:cc&#x3D;on”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-specific-tag2.png"                      alt="add a specific tag"                ></p><p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Click Save Edit</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-save-change3.png"                      alt="click save changes"                ></p><p> There you go!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keep-youtube-cc4.png"                      alt="keep youtube cc"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Embed-your-Videos-with-Closed-Captions-on-your-website"><a href="#How-to-Embed-your-Videos-with-Closed-Captions-on-your-website" class="headerlink" title="How to Embed your Videos with Closed Captions on your website"></a><strong>How to Embed your Videos with Closed Captions on your website</strong></h2><p>Some of you might also want to embed YouTube videos on your website.

This is achieved using a simple process of clicking “import” from the “file” drop-down menu. Once you have finished importing your photos or video files, you can then drag them from the sidebar and into the editing area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-interface.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h5><ul><li>If the videos you want to import are already published online, you can start the process by first downloading them directly from YouTube first, making sure to save them as MP4 files.</li><li>The best way of importing videos from YouTube is by using an innovative video converter like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate. This program will help in downloading and converting files to a format that is supported by Adobe Premier.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-2-Editing"><a href="#Step-2-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Editing"></a>Step 2: Editing</h4><p> The next step in how edit YouTube videos with Adobe Premiere is to start modifying the video files or photos the way you want. To achieve this, click on “Effects Control” and apply the desired effects. If you want to insert some text or words into your video, select “title” and then click “new title.” Now choose how you would like the words to behave, for instance, “Default Roll” makes the text roll upwards in the page.</p><p> Now drag the text that you have created into the editor area. If you want to edit the text, simply double-click to select it, and it will bring up a separate page where you can make further edits. You can then modify the text, font, and the positioning as well. This page also allows you to set whether the text will crawl or roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-text-with-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p> The final part of the process is to import your chosen audio file. This could be the chosen soundtrack for your presentation. Simply drag the audio file onto your editor.
