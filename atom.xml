All the uploads that the user has made before are added to the YouTube Video Editor. The tool allows the user to combine, trim, add music and customize. However, its functionality is limited to just that, and that’s why people are looking for the best YouTube Video Editor alternative.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editor alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from this complete guide.</p><p>Some of the cons of the YouTube Video Editor are:</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced editing features.</li><li>It requires Internet connection to use.</li><li>It is slow.</li><li>Users can only edit videos that were already uploaded to their YouTube account.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-5-YouTube-Video-Editor-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-YouTube-Video-Editor-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives"></a>Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives</h2><p>The good news is that there are good offline YouTube Video Editor Alternatives out there. Below are the top five:</p><h4 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.  Wondershare Filmora"></a>1.  Wondershare Filmora</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the most popular YouTube Video Editor alternatives. It is available for both Windows and Mac platforms. The best thing about Wondershare Filmora is that it is easy to use. And at the same time, it has more features than the YouTube Video Editor.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>Some of the key features of Filmora include:</p><ul><li>Allows the user to crop, cut, and combine video clips in just a few clicks</li><li>Supports the addition of multiple audio and video tracks</li><li>Choose from various overlays and filters</li><li>Supports face off, green screen, and PIP effects</li><li>Supports a wide range of video formats that include MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WMV, just to name a few</li><li>Burn video to DVD, or instantly upload it to YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo</li></ul><h4 id="2-WeVideo"><a href="#2-WeVideo" class="headerlink" title="2.  WeVideo"></a>2.  WeVideo</h4><p>Another YouTube Video Editor alternative is <a class="link"   href="https://www.wevideo.com/" >WeVideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a cloud-based video editor that allows the user to do the editing in any web browser. Just like the YouTube editing tool, the user must first upload the clips online in order to edit them, and create a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bdayvideo-wevideo.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>One advantage of WeVideo is that it allows different users to collaborate in making a single video. A user can invite others to upload clips to the project, or even make different videos based on the same clips.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>And because it is a cloud-based video editor, it requires an Internet connection in order to get the clips and do the editing. Not only that, the videos must be uploaded before they can be used. And there are cases in which a five-minute video will require hours of raw footages. Users with slow upload speeds will take hours before they can start editing. And users of the free version can only export 480p videos that have a watermark. Users need to pay for the full version.</p><h4 id="3-Loopster"><a href="#3-Loopster" class="headerlink" title="3. Loopster"></a>3. Loopster</h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.loopster.com/" >Loopster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a mobile app that can be a YouTube Video Editor alternative. It is available for both the Android and iOS platforms. The tool allows the user to rotate, splice and add sound effects, zoom, and crop videos directly from one’s smartphone. It comes with advanced features that include title screens, slow motion effect, and bubble text. The app also lets the user record video and sounds directly. After editing the video, the app can export it directly to Facebook or YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loopster.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>It does what it was designed to do when it is working. It is user-friendly and comes with a tutorial. It also works even if the smartphone is not connected to the internet. Editing is done offline. And best of all, it is free.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>One the downside, it looks like the developer is no longer updating the app. Some users experience crashes and other bugs. There are also some users that stated that the slow motion effect didn’t work for them, which is why they can’t recommend it as a YouTube Video Editor alternative.</p><h4 id="4-Tubechop"><a href="#4-Tubechop" class="headerlink" title="4. Tubechop"></a>4. Tubechop</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tubechop.com/" >Tubechop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows the user to trim a video from any YouTube video and then share it. There are some videos that are just too long, and you want to cut it to the section that you find interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubechop.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>Just like the other YouTube Video Editor alternatives, Tubechop is easy to use. The user just needs to enter the YouTube URL of the video, and then indicate the section that’s interesting, and that’s it.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>However, Tubechop doesn’t allow users to download the resulting video. Tubechop only provides a link that allows users to view the chopped video. And when the original video is deleted, the chopped version will also be deleted.</p><h4 id="5-Viddyad"><a href="#5-Viddyad" class="headerlink" title="5. Viddyad"></a>5. Viddyad</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://viddyad.com/" >Viddyad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another cloud-based platform that lets users convert images, music, clips, and animated effects into a video. It is said to be the best way to create video ads for businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viddyad.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>There are several templates to choose from. Users can create video ads by adding videos, text, voiceover, special effects, music, and images. The platform also provides access to millions of image and video stock.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>Viddyad is a YouTube Video Editor alternative for businesses that want to create video ads. It might not be the right video editor for individuals who just want to create and share their personal videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/downloader-essentials-the-best-tools-for-offline-viewing-for-2024/"><u>Downloader Essentials  The Best Tools For Offline Viewing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/audio-matters-ensuring-excellent-sound-in-your-youtube-shots-for-2024/"><u>Audio Matters  Ensuring Excellent Sound in Your YouTube Shots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-building-a-brand-on-youtube-navigating-through-top-video-marketing-methods/"><u>In 2024, Building a Brand on YouTube  Navigating Through Top Video Marketing Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-customizing-youtube-direct-subscription-urls/"><u>[Updated] Customizing YouTube Direct Subscription URLs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-do-youtubers-get-paid-monthly/"><u>2024 Approved  Do YouTubers Get Paid Monthly?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-embark-on-the-journey-defining-and-developing-style-and-niche/"><u>[New] Embark on the Journey  Defining & Developing Style and Niche</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-capture-youtubes-subtitles-on-no-cost-platforms/"><u>In 2024, Capture YouTube's Subtitles on No-Cost Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/dominate-search-results-essential-tips-for-optimizing-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>Dominate Search Results  Essential Tips for Optimizing YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/perfect-mac-video-capturer/"><u>Perfect Mac Video Capturer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-securely-accessing-insta-stories-anon-pcandroidios-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Securely Accessing Insta Stories Anon  PC/Android/iOS Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamlining-zoom-sessions-through-effective-recording/"><u>In 2024, Streamlining Zoom Sessions Through Effective Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-insta-cover-chronicles-top-tier-tech-edition/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Insta Cover Chronicles  Top-Tier Tech Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-photos-from-nokia-xr21-to-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Photos From Nokia XR21 to Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-what-is-first-impression-review-video/"><u>Updated What Is First Impression Review Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/seamless-backdrop-switches-for-google-meet-users-for-2024/"><u>Seamless Backdrop Switches for Google Meet Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-innovate-with-ease-top-sites-for-downloadable-text-extensions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Innovate with Ease  Top Sites for Downloadable Text Extensions for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

There wouldn’t be mashups, parodies, or lip dubs. Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p><p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p><ol><li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li><li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li><li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p><p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p><p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p><p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p><p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p><p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike"></a>Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike</h2><p>If you are reading this, you may have already gotten a YouTube copyright strike.</p><p>This may have surprised you. Don’t be too concerned. If it was a mistake, the copyright strike merely acts as a warning, letting you know that the content in your video is copyrighted material.</p><p>However, if you were to get 3 copyright strikes in 90 days, you may be penalized by:</p><p>- Having all your accounts and videos removed</p><p>- Not being able to create a new channel</p><p>So what should you do? Here are the steps to take after you receive a copyright strike:</p><ol><li><p>Review the copyright strike by going into Creator Studio &gt; Video Manager &gt; Copyright notice <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-copyright-notice.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Copyright notice"                ></p></li><li><p>Click on the “Copyright Strike” link beside the flagged video to see details</p></li><li><p>Decide how to respond to the strike:  </p><ol><li>Allow the strike to expire after 90 days and complete the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >YouTube’s copyright school <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  </li><li>Contact the person who reported your video and get the claim retracted  </li><li>Dispute the claim with a counter notification <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dispute-youtube-copyright-claim.jpg"                      alt="Dispute YouTube Copyright Claims"                ></li></ol></li></ol><h2 id="Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike"></a>Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike</h2><p>It’s not always clear what YouTube deems fair use, but there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of meeting the qualification.</p><p><strong>1. Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p><p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p><p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p><p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p><p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p><p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p><p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p><p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content"></a>Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content</h2><p>As a new YouTuber, it’s a little freaky to think that someone is taking your content and republishing it or using your creations in their video without your permission.</p><p>If you ever notice that your content is being copied without your approval — if they have duplicated your video completely or is using your video without giving credit — and it is not benefiting your channel in any way, don’t worry, YouTube is designed to protect you.</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube"><a href="#Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube"></a><strong>Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube</strong></h4><ol><li>View the video that contains your copyrighted material.</li><li>Click on “Report”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-copyright-infringement-youtube.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Select “Infringes my rights” in the pop up window and click “infringes my copyright” in the dropdown options.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/infringe-my-copyright-report.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Supply additional information to the report form, including the URL of the video infringing your copyrighted content and the URL of your own video.</li><li>Submit report and wait for an email confirmation that the infringing content has been removed.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match"><a href="#Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match"></a>Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match</h2><p>In 2018, YouTube launched a new feature called <strong>Copyright Match Tool</strong>, which automatically finds videos that are very similar or the same as the ones you’ve created. This gives you the power to determine what to do once you know the video exist.</p><p>- You can choose to do nothing.</p><p>- You can contact the publisher.</p><p>- You can report the video to YouTube for removal.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><p>I hope this article has clarified what you can and cannot do with copyrighted content. Here is a quick summary of what we touched on in this post:</p><p>- Avoid having 3 copyright strikes on your channel at all costs.</p><p>- When using copyrighted material, ensure it is essential to the video and you are not overdoing it.</p><p>- Make sure that the copyrighted content does not take views and sales away from the original source.</p><p>- Strive to use the copyrighted content in a transformative way, as a parody or a commentary, to educate or inform.</p><p>- Give the original creator credit or have it benefit the original by giving more publicity.</p><p>- Report any creator that is infringing on your content.</p><p>Got any questions on YouTube copyright?

Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p><h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p><h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p><p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p><h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p><p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p><h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p><p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p><p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p><h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand" class="headerlink" title="7. Build a Strong Personal Brand"></a>7. Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p><p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p><h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p><h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p><p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p><p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p><h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video" class="headerlink" title="10. Add a YouTube Intro Video"></a>10. Add a YouTube Intro Video</h2><p>A professional-looking intro clip (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn how to make one here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions"><a href="#11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="11. Use Video Effects and Transitions"></a>11. Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p><p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p><p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p><h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p><p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p><h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it’s much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.</p><p>Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.</p><h2 id="15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media"><a href="#15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media"></a>15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media</h2><p>Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html" >the promotion that you do through social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="16-Interact-with-your-Viewers"><a href="#16-Interact-with-your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="16.

Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&amp;A videos.</p><h2 id="17-Check-Out-the-Big-Channels-in-Your-Genre"><a href="#17-Check-Out-the-Big-Channels-in-Your-Genre" class="headerlink" title="17.

By looking at the popular channels in your genre you can learn what kinds of videos are popular and what types of video titles and tags you should be using.</p><h2 id="18-Do-Collaboration-Videos"><a href="#18-Do-Collaboration-Videos" class="headerlink" title="18. Do Collaboration Videos"></a>18. Do Collaboration Videos</h2><p>When you <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >collaborate with other YouTube creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It’s amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.</p><p>Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.</p><h2 id="19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video"><a href="#19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video" class="headerlink" title="19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video"></a>19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video</h2><p>The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO&#x2F;search engine optimization.</p><h2 id="20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable"><a href="#20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable" class="headerlink" title="20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable"></a>20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable</h2><p>In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.</p><p>For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent"><a href="#21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent"></a>21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent</h2><p>The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html" >create a familiar look <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.</p><h2 id="22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos"></a>22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos</h2><p>If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.</p><h2 id="23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views"><a href="#23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views" class="headerlink" title="23. Make Titles that Get Views"></a>23. Make Titles that Get Views</h2><p>Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.</p><h2 id="24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer"></a>24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer</h2><p>Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.</p><p>You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.</p><h2 id="25-Give-Each-of-Your-Videos-a-Memorable-Ending"><a href="#25-Give-Each-of-Your-Videos-a-Memorable-Ending" class="headerlink" title="25.

The split feature in Filmora can cut footage into parts and then you can move it to desired position or just delete the unnecessary part. You can choose any part of the video quickly with the Quick Trim feature in preview. Besides, Filmora supports almost all popular video and photo formats, so there will be no obstacle when you want to combine footage shot with different devices. You can add photos to video or audio to video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-split.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Split Feature"                ></p><p>To combine several footages into one, just place all clips in the video track in order.

To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.</p><h4 id="Record-tons-of-footage"><a href="#Record-tons-of-footage" class="headerlink" title="Record tons of footage"></a>Record tons of footage</h4><p>Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time"><a href="#Focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time" class="headerlink" title="Focus on one thing at a time"></a>Focus on one thing at a time</h4><p>While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="Add-voiceovers"><a href="#Add-voiceovers" class="headerlink" title="Add voiceovers"></a>Add voiceovers</h4><p>A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.</p><h4 id="Edit-your-videos-with-an-excellent-video-editor"><a href="#Edit-your-videos-with-an-excellent-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="Edit your videos with an excellent video editor"></a>Edit your videos with an excellent video editor</h4><p>If you wish to come up with appealing travel videos, then a video editor would be a must-have tool for you. I would recommend using <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>, which is one of the most extensive and user-friendly video editors out there. You can easily clip the footage of your choice, add voiceovers, and include different transitions. There are tons of presets and media layers that you can include in your videos to make them stand out.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Be-authentic"><a href="#Be-authentic" class="headerlink" title="Be authentic"></a>Be authentic</h4><p>In the end, make sure that you share a genuine experience with others. Try not to overly glorify a thing or provide a partial experience in your travel videos. Be authentic and share your experience while traveling to come up with personal yet beautifully-shot videos.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post on some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired as well.

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p><h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p><p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p><h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p><p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p><h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p><h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p><h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p><h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p><h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p><p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p><h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p><p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p><p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p><p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p><p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p><h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed.

Even the name of the file you’re uploading to your channel should contain a keyword, and once the upload is completed you should add a title, description, and metadata if you would like to increase the video’s visibility on the platform. It is vital to select your YouTube SEO strategy before you actually start adding new videos to your strategy.

Create Visually Captivating Thumbnails and End Screen Elements</h4><p>A thumbnail is usually a snapshot of a frame from a video, you’ve created during the video editing process or any other still image that suggests what the video is about. A small thing like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adding a thumbnail to a YouTube video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can increase both the number of views and the number of likes that video is getting. In addition, YouTube’s video editor enables you to <strong>add end screens</strong> that last anywhere between five and twenty seconds to your videos, but keep in mind that the video must be at least 25 seconds long to have an end screen. There are a number of fully customizable templates available that can be uses to promote your upcoming videos or to invite viewers to subscribe to your channel.</p><p>Wanna making YouTube thumbnail yourself?

How to Work Out "></a>1.  How to Work Out <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fitness-youtube-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Fitness Video Ideas"                ></h4><p>Life is a process of constantly learning how to do new things, and educational videos on YouTube allow us to learn whatever we want. Most people don’t know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.</p><h4 id="2-Vitamins-Supplements"><a href="#2-Vitamins-Supplements" class="headerlink" title="2.  Vitamins, Supplements"></a>2.  Vitamins, Supplements</h4><p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.</p><p>If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.</p><h4 id="3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts"><a href="#3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.</p><h4 id="8-Motivational-Video"><a href="#8-Motivational-Video" class="headerlink" title="8.  Motivational Video"></a>8.  Motivational Video</h4><p>The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.</p><h4 id="9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information"><a href="#9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information" class="headerlink" title="9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information"></a>9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information</h4><p>We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.</p><h4 id="10-Your-Fitness-Journey"><a href="#10-Your-Fitness-Journey" class="headerlink" title="10.  Your Fitness Journey"></a>10.  Your Fitness Journey</h4><p>Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.</p><h4 id="11-Weight-Loss-Advice"><a href="#11-Weight-Loss-Advice" class="headerlink" title="11.  Weight Loss Advice"></a>11.  Weight Loss Advice</h4><p>For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease. That’s why YouTube videos that offer advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way, or which provide guidance through the process, can help you build an audience on YouTube.</p><p>Need more video ideas?

No. It depends. If you are a determined and ambitious beginner, it’s a good decision to invest in advanced cameras when you have an adequate budget.

action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They’re heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you’re doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they’re small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera’s 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube’s battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos</em> <em>- Multiple mounting options</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Low-quality built-in microphone</em> <em>- No preview screen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png"                      alt="Yi 4K"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19” LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera’s 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera’s high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Weighs only 3.4 Oz</em> <em>- Powerful electronic image stabilization</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited mounting capabilities</em> <em>- The camera’s fisheye lens can distort footage</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png"                      alt="Nikon B500"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon’s Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500’s ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera’s 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn’t have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn’t have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Great connectivity features</em> <em>- 80x optical zoom</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No manual exposure controls</em> <em>- Limited ISO sensitivity</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png"                      alt="Nikon A900"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f&#x2F;3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900’s ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200. Consequently, this camera won’t be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- 4K and Full HD video recording options</em> <em>- Manual exposure control</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited audio recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png"                      alt="Sony a5100"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony’s a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony’s E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- AF speeds exceed all expectations</em> <em>- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Fake shutter sounds</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> supports most video formats that you can find.

The good news is that time spent on YouTube is on the rise around the world. There’s no reason you can’t have a slice of that gigantic pie.</p><p>When it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >running a successful YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it’s all about subscribers. The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.</p><p>It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth. So, as a YouTube creator, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html" >growing your subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should definitely be a top priority.</p><p>There are many tips out there on how to go about <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-top-10-smartest-ways-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-311.html" >increasing your YouTube subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this post, we share 4 simple and smart tricks to get the process rolling.</p><ol><li><a href="#links"><strong>Make Sure All Your Links Are Subscribe Links</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#sort">Sort Your Videos Into Playlists</a></strong></li><li><a href="#trailer"><strong>Create a Channel Trailer or Set a Featured Video</strong></a></li><li><a href="#rivals"><strong>Add Your Rivals To Your Tags</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS"><a href="#1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS" class="headerlink" title="1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS"></a><strong>1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS</strong></h2><p>This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.</p><p>All you need do is add ‘_?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.</p><p>Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.</p><h2 id="2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS"><a href="#2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS" class="headerlink" title="2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS"></a><strong>2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS</strong></h2><p>Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Creating playlists on your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.</p><p>You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.</p><h2 id="3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO"><a href="#3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO" class="headerlink" title="3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO"></a><strong>3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO</strong></h2><p>Most dedicated YouTube creators have made <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.</p><p>YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.</p><p>That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.</p><h2 id="4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS"><a href="#4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS" class="headerlink" title="4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS"></a><strong>4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS</strong></h2><p>Adding your rival’s names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.</p><p>To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly.

You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partner’s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isn’t why you should collab, it’s how.</p><p>Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging.

Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p><p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p><h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p><p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p><h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p><p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p><h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p><h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p><h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg"                      alt="collab pitch examples"                ></p><p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Here are some more tips:</p><h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p><h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p><h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p><h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p><h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p><p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p><h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partner’s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.</p><p>Make sure to agree beforehand on how long you’ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesn’t go on way longer than the other.</p><p>This probably isn’t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldn’t check out someone’s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.</p><h4 id="Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the ‘host’ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.</p><p> Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.</p><p>In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.</p><h4 id="Long-Distance-Collaborations"><a href="#Long-Distance-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="Long Distance Collaborations"></a><strong>Long Distance Collaborations</strong></h4><p> It’s harder to collab if you can’t meet up, but it isn’t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p><h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p><h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p><p>You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if you’re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to ‘public’ at the exact same time.</p><h4 id="Promote-Your-Collab"><a href="#Promote-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Promote Your Collab"></a><strong>Promote Your Collab</strong></h4><p>Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.</p><h4 id="Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Comment on Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Comment on Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>After you’ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner’s subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you’re buddies with one of their favorite creators.</p><p> Make sure to discuss how much promotion you’ll each do for the collab before and after it launches.

That’s pretty common.</p><p>If you have a DSLR then you can set it down on any stable surface while filming yourself, but your phone can’t stand up by itself. It needs something or someone to hold it. Do you just accept that and shoot everything as a selfie?</p><p>No. No, you don’t, because there are common household items that can help you out of this problem. For this DIY tripod, you need either <strong>2 binder clips</strong> or <strong>2 ‘claw clips’</strong> (also called ‘hair jaws’).</p><p>Hold your phone in landscape mode (horizontally, so it’s long rather than tall) and attach clips to the bottom corners. If you are worried about scratching your screen, fold up some paper to place between your clip and your phone.</p><p>Here it is with binder clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/binder-clips.jpg"                      alt="binder clips"                ></p><p>And here it is with hair clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hair-clips.jpg"                      alt="hair clips"                ></p><p>Now you can set your smartphone upon any stable surface, like a table or a stack of books.</p><p> <em>Here are some more cool ideas!</em></p><h3 id="DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel"><a href="#DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel" class="headerlink" title="DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel"></a><strong>DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel</strong></h3><p>You’ve probably heard a million times that you can stabilize your camera by sitting it down on any stable surface – on your desk, on a stack of books, up in a tree, etc. This is very true!</p><p>But if you can use any stable surface, why do people buy tripods?</p><p>Because it isn’t convenient to rearrange your furniture whenever you want to make a video, and also because tripods are adjustable. You can change their height, you can use them to pan or tilt, and it’s pretty easy to move them a bit forwards or backward while you’re setting up your shot.</p><p>To get similar functions from the ‘any stable surface’ solution you can use a <strong>table</strong>, a <strong>stack of books</strong>, and a <strong>towel</strong>.</p><ol><li>Set up the area where you’re going to sit while you’re filming on one end of the table.</li><li>Put the towel down over the approximate spot you want your camera to be.</li><li>Stack your books on top of the towel.</li><li>Put your camera on top of the books.</li></ol><p>Now if your camera isn’t up high enough, or is too high, you can adjust it just by adding or taking away books. If you want to move it closer or farther away from you, just pull the towel forwards or backward.</p><h3 id="DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape"><a href="#DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape" class="headerlink" title="DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape"></a><strong>DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape</strong></h3><p>Gorillapod’s are cool because you can use them like normal tripods, carry them around like selfie sticks, or attach them to things like fences and posts. Here’s how you can make something similar using <strong>wire</strong>, <strong>electrical tape</strong> or <strong>duct tape</strong>, and a <strong>1&#x2F;4 bolt</strong>.</p><p>Your wire should be fairly stiff and you’ll need three pieces the same length, which should be at least 10 inches. Old clothes hangers work well. This needs to be something strong enough to support the weight of your camera, but soft enough that it’s not impossible for you to bend.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wire-and-type.jpg"                      alt="wire and type"                ></p><p><em>All of your supplies plus the finished product.</em></p><p><strong>Readying your legs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Bend 2 inches at one end of each wire into a ‘U’ shape. You will probably need pliers for this.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Pick up one of your pieces of wire and wrap one end with electrical tape. Go around 5-10 times (to prevent it from coming undone at the end) and then, without cutting your tape, start moving up and wrapping the rest of your wire. Stop before your ‘U’ section.</p><p>Repeat this with the other two wires.</p><p> <strong>Attaching your legs</strong></p><p><em><strong>Step 1:</strong></em> Place the ‘U’ section of a leg against your bolt. The bolt’s threading should be pointing away from the leg. Now, use your tape to attach them. Wind it around 2 or 3 times, then repeat the process with both of the other legs individually.</p><p><em><strong>Step 2:</strong></em> After all the legs are attached, wrap some more tape around all 3 as tightly as you can.</p><p> Your camera will mount onto the bolt! You’ll be able to use this as a normal table-top tripod or use the flexible legs to grab onto different things like a Gorillapod. <em>Read more at</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Tripod/"><em>Instructables</em>.</a></p><p><em>Note: make sure the bolt is a fit for your camera before you get too far into this process.</em> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-bringing-text-to-life-a-guide-to-dynamic-animation-methods/"><u>[New] Bringing Text to Life  A Guide to Dynamic Animation Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-beatcut-studio-pro-audio-film-fusion-on-pc/"><u>[Updated] BeatCut Studio Pro  Audio-Film Fusion on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/discover-10-swift-growing-youtube-sources-for-inspiration/"><u>Discover 10 Swift-Growing YouTube Sources for Inspiration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/brighten-up-your-videos-implementing-neons-on-thumbnails-for-2024/"><u>Brighten Up Your Videos  Implementing Neons on Thumbnails for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/deciphering-youtube-monetization-success-codes/"><u>Deciphering YouTube Monetization Success Codes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/swiftly-adapt-video-formats-for-mac-pixels/"><u>Swiftly Adapt Video Formats for MAC Pixels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/how-to-enable-monetization-on-youtube-for-mobile-devices-a-2024-guide/"><u>How to Enable Monetization on YouTube for Mobile Devices  A 2024 Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-revolutionize-virtual-participation-with-top-10-free-recorder-software/"><u>In 2024, Revolutionize Virtual Participation with Top 10 Free Recorder Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-premium-screen-recording-selections/"><u>In 2024, Premium Screen Recording Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instagrams-selfie-codex-decoding-image-integrity/"><u>2024 Approved  Instagram's Selfie Codex  Decoding Image Integrity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-get-the-rare-candy-on-pokemon-go-fire-red-on-xiaomi-civi-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Xiaomi Civi 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-groundbreaking-alternatives-to-the-conventional-fbx-recorder-games/"><u>In 2024, Groundbreaking Alternatives to the Conventional FBX Recorder Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-update-iphone-6-without-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Update iPhone 6 without iTunes? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/play-store-not-working-on-itel-p55-5g-8-solutions-inside-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Not Working On Itel P55 5G? 8 Solutions Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-advanced-audio-alliance-for-podcasters/"><u>[New] Advanced Audio Alliance for Podcasters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-ways-to-transfer-photos-from-oneplus-nord-ce-3-lite-5g-to-iphone-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Ways to Transfer Photos from OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G to iPhone Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
