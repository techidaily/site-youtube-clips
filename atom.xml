It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Content-Relevance"><a href="#Content-Relevance" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Audience-Appeal"><a href="#Audience-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg"                      border="0"                >PearlMountain Image Converter</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Personal-Branding"><a href="#Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a <strong>green screen background for YouTube videos</strong>.</p><h2 id="5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas"><a href="#5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas"></a><strong>5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas</strong></h2><p>It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><ul><li>Snowy Landscape</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-1.png"                      alt="snowy landscape youtube background"                ></p><ul><li>Festive Holiday Decor</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-2.png"                      alt="festive holiday decor image"                ></p><ul><li>Cozy Indoor Settings</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal-1"><a href="#Audience-Appeal-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility-1"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility-1" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding-1"><a href="#Personal-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Editing-1"><a href="#Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on.

Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Blender"><a href="#2-Blender" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.</p><h4 id="3-Renderforest"><a href="#3-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="3.

The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.</p><h4 id="4-MotionDen"><a href="#4-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="4.

The app’s text editing capabilities are remarkable since you can animate the text with twenty different animations, change a font or control the shadows.

Most people don’t know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.</p><h4 id="2-Vitamins-Supplements"><a href="#2-Vitamins-Supplements" class="headerlink" title="2.  Vitamins, Supplements"></a>2.  Vitamins, Supplements</h4><p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.</p><p>If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.</p><h4 id="3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts"><a href="#3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do.

Most people don’t know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.</p><h4 id="2-Vitamins-Supplements-3"><a href="#2-Vitamins-Supplements-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Vitamins, Supplements"></a>2.  Vitamins, Supplements</h4><p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.</p><p>If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.</p><h4 id="3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts-3"><a href="#3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos-3"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos-3"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine-3"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine-3" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans-3"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans-3" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.</p><h4 id="8-Motivational-Video-3"><a href="#8-Motivational-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="8.  Motivational Video"></a>8.  Motivational Video</h4><p>The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.</p><h4 id="9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information-3"><a href="#9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information-3" class="headerlink" title="9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information"></a>9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information</h4><p>We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.</p><h4 id="10-Your-Fitness-Journey-3"><a href="#10-Your-Fitness-Journey-3" class="headerlink" title="10.  Your Fitness Journey"></a>10.  Your Fitness Journey</h4><p>Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.</p><h4 id="11-Weight-Loss-Advice-3"><a href="#11-Weight-Loss-Advice-3" class="headerlink" title="11.

Unlisted videos will not be included in any of the Google search engine results and only individuals that have the link will be able to view the videos on YouTube. A person does not have to have a Google account or any type of password to see unlisted videos, only the link, which means the people you share the video with will also be able to share it with whoever they like.</p><p>To share an unlisted video, simply send its URL to anyone you want to watch it.

Unlisted videos will not be included in any of the Google search engine results and only individuals that have the link will be able to view the videos on YouTube. A person does not have to have a Google account or any type of password to see unlisted videos, only the link, which means the people you share the video with will also be able to share it with whoever they like.</p><p>To share an unlisted video, simply send its URL to anyone you want to watch it. This is easier than sharing private YouTube videos, but not quite as private.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top"

The majority of the audience on YouTube isn’t patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).</p><p>Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it’s short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.</p><h4 id="2-Start-a-Funny-Series-3"><a href="#2-Start-a-Funny-Series-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.</p><p>It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won’t get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.</p><h4 id="4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits-3"><a href="#4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.</p><p>The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.</p><h4 id="5-Parody-Video-3"><a href="#5-Parody-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.</p><p>Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.</p><h4 id="6-Bloopers-3"><a href="#6-Bloopers-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else’s shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you’re lip-syncing.</p><p>Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.</p><p>Need more YouTube video ideas?

platform is a solace to many users. You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference. Dive into the next section to discover whether TikTok’s impact is about to be threatened by YouTube Shorts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shorts-tiktok-compare.png"                      alt="compare youtube shorts with tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</a></p><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?"></a>Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</h2><p>Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.</p><p>They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?"></a>YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</h2><p>Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similiarity"><a href="#Similiarity" class="headerlink" title="- Similiarity"></a>- Similiarity</h3><p>Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.</p><h5 id="1-Monetization"><a href="#1-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="1) Monetization"></a>1) Monetization</h5><p>Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics"><a href="#2-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy"><a href="#4-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.</p><h5 id="5-Edit-video"><a href="#5-Edit-video" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit video"></a>5) Edit video</h5><p>There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.</p><h3 id="Difference"><a href="#Difference" class="headerlink" title="- Difference"></a>- Difference</h3><h5 id="1-Instant-messaging-app"><a href="#1-Instant-messaging-app" class="headerlink" title="1) Instant messaging app"></a>1) Instant messaging app</h5><p>Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability"><a href="#2-In-dependability" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface"><a href="#3-Interface" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><h3 id="What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need"><a href="#What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need" class="headerlink" title="- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need"></a>- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need</h3><p>Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen.

You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference. Dive into the next section to discover whether TikTok’s impact is about to be threatened by YouTube Shorts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shorts-tiktok-compare.png"                      alt="compare youtube shorts with tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing-3"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing-3" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?"></a>Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</h2><p>Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.</p><p>They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage-3"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?"></a>YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</h2><p>Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics-3"><a href="#2-Analytics-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators-3"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy-3"><a href="#4-Privacy-3" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.</p><h5 id="5-Edit-video-3"><a href="#5-Edit-video-3" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit video"></a>5) Edit video</h5><p>There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.</p><h3 id="Difference-3"><a href="#Difference-3" class="headerlink" title="- Difference"></a>- Difference</h3><h5 id="1-Instant-messaging-app-3"><a href="#1-Instant-messaging-app-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Instant messaging app"></a>1) Instant messaging app</h5><p>Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability-3"><a href="#2-In-dependability-3" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface-3"><a href="#3-Interface-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen.

But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen.

Most people don’t know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.</p><h4 id="2-Vitamins-Supplements"><a href="#2-Vitamins-Supplements" class="headerlink" title="2.  Vitamins, Supplements"></a>2.  Vitamins, Supplements</h4><p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.</p><p>If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.</p><h4 id="3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts"><a href="#3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.</p><h4 id="8-Motivational-Video"><a href="#8-Motivational-Video" class="headerlink" title="8.  Motivational Video"></a>8.  Motivational Video</h4><p>The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.</p><h4 id="9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information"><a href="#9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information" class="headerlink" title="9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information"></a>9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information</h4><p>We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.</p><h4 id="10-Your-Fitness-Journey"><a href="#10-Your-Fitness-Journey" class="headerlink" title="10.  Your Fitness Journey"></a>10.  Your Fitness Journey</h4><p>Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.</p><h4 id="11-Weight-Loss-Advice"><a href="#11-Weight-Loss-Advice" class="headerlink" title="11.  Weight Loss Advice"></a>11.  Weight Loss Advice</h4><p>For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease. That’s why YouTube videos that offer advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way, or which provide guidance through the process, can help you build an audience on YouTube.</p><p>Need more video ideas?

Most people don’t know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.</p><h4 id="2-Vitamins-Supplements-3"><a href="#2-Vitamins-Supplements-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Vitamins, Supplements"></a>2.  Vitamins, Supplements</h4><p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.</p><p>If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.</p><h4 id="3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts-3"><a href="#3-Cheap-Fitness-No-Equipment-At-Home-Workouts-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos-3"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos-3"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine-3"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine-3" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans-3"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans-3" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.</p><h4 id="8-Motivational-Video-3"><a href="#8-Motivational-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="8.  Motivational Video"></a>8.  Motivational Video</h4><p>The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.</p><h4 id="9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information-3"><a href="#9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information-3" class="headerlink" title="9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information"></a>9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information</h4><p>We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.</p><h4 id="10-Your-Fitness-Journey-3"><a href="#10-Your-Fitness-Journey-3" class="headerlink" title="10.  Your Fitness Journey"></a>10.  Your Fitness Journey</h4><p>Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.</p><h4 id="11-Weight-Loss-Advice-3"><a href="#11-Weight-Loss-Advice-3" class="headerlink" title="11.  Weight Loss Advice"></a>11.  Weight Loss Advice</h4><p>For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease. That’s why YouTube videos that offer advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way, or which provide guidance through the process, can help you build an audience on YouTube.</p><p>Need more video ideas?

Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)</h2><p>If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your device’s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at <a class="link"   href="http://www.airsquirrels.com/" >Airsquirrels.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.Next, you need to have Apple’s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computer’s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.</p><p>You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.</p><p>If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After reading the three ways to record YouTube on iPhone&#x2F;iPad, I am sure you want to give it a try.

Mograph</a></p><p><a href="#lynda">Richard Harrington on Lynda</a></p><p><a href="#bloop">Bloop Animation</a></p><p><a href="#videocopilot">Video Copilot</a></p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-video-effects.png"                      alt="Video Animation"                ></p><p> All of these resources will teach Adobe After Effects, or a similar paid software. If you do not have access to Adobe After Effects, you might want to check out our post on <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-or-cheap-animation-software-for-video-creators-122.html" >affordable animation software for video creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Mt-Mograph-3"><a href="#Mt-Mograph-3" class="headerlink" title="Mt. Mograph"></a><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUSgx9qc%5FNydrOL59xbJIA" >Mt. Mograph <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>On this YouTube channel, motion graphics specialist Matt offers free animation tutorials using a variety of programs including Adobe After Effects and Cinema 4D. His lessons are for a range of skill levels, from beginner to advanced. If you are just starting out then Mt.Mograph is a great resource.</p><h2 id="Richard-Harrington-on-Lynda-3"><a href="#Richard-Harrington-on-Lynda-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Harrington on Lynda"></a><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.lynda.com/Rich-Harrington/120-1.html" >Richard Harrington on Lynda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Lynda isn’t free, but the 10-day free trial period is definitely long enough for you to watch this two-hour course.</p><p>What’s great about this course is that it assumes you have no animation experience, and it walks you through the main thing a lot of YouTubers want to learn animation for – creating an animated logo.</p><h2 id="Bloop-Animation-3"><a href="#Bloop-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Bloop Animation"></a><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/" >Bloop Animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p> Most of the video animation courses on this site are paid, but they have a lot of cool free tutorials as well. The focus is more on animating figures&#x2F;cartoons than video effects, but if you have any interest in animation more generally then this is a great place to start learning. They even have a free ebook you can download which is targeted at beginners.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

When you <strong>transcribe a YouTube video</strong>, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:</p><ul><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></li></ul><p>When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>Accent</strong></li></ul><p>If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Repurposing on Blogs</strong></li></ul><p>If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Transcription FAQs"></a>YouTube Video Transcription FAQs</h3><h4 id="1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text"><a href="#1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1.

How to Transcribe YouTube Video to Text</h4><p>Usually the transcription files have *.srt extension that are globally accepted and supported by almost all media players. However, there might be instances when you want to have the subtitles in plain text.</p><p>That said, to convert an SRT file to TXT, you can:</p><ul><li>Right-click the <strong>SRT</strong> file</li><li>Go to <strong>Rename</strong></li><li>Replace <strong>srt</strong> with <strong>txt</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on the confirmation box that appears next to convert SRT to TXT</li></ul><p>After this, you can simply double-click the file, and read and modify the transcribed content as needed.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Edit-and-Upload-Edited-Transcript-to-YouTube"><a href="#2-How-to-Edit-and-Upload-Edited-Transcript-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2.

When you <strong>transcribe a YouTube video</strong>, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:</p><ul><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></li></ul><p>When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>Accent</strong></li></ul><p>If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Repurposing on Blogs</strong></li></ul><p>If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs-1"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Transcription FAQs"></a>YouTube Video Transcription FAQs</h3><h4 id="1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text-1"><a href="#1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

How to Transcribe YouTube Video to Text</h4><p>Usually the transcription files have *.srt extension that are globally accepted and supported by almost all media players. However, there might be instances when you want to have the subtitles in plain text.</p><p>That said, to convert an SRT file to TXT, you can:</p><ul><li>Right-click the <strong>SRT</strong> file</li><li>Go to <strong>Rename</strong></li><li>Replace <strong>srt</strong> with <strong>txt</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on the confirmation box that appears next to convert SRT to TXT</li></ul><p>After this, you can simply double-click the file, and read and modify the transcribed content as needed.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Edit-and-Upload-Edited-Transcript-to-YouTube-1"><a href="#2-How-to-Edit-and-Upload-Edited-Transcript-to-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos</h2><p>You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you <strong>transcribe a YouTube video</strong>, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:</p><ul><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></li></ul><p>When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>Accent</strong></li></ul><p>If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Repurposing on Blogs</strong></li></ul><p>If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs-2"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs-2" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Transcription FAQs"></a>YouTube Video Transcription FAQs</h3><h4 id="1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text-2"><a href="#1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you <strong>transcribe a YouTube video</strong>, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:</p><ul><li><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></li></ul><p>When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.</p><ul><li><strong>Accent</strong></li></ul><p>If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Repurposing on Blogs</strong></li></ul><p>If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs-3"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Transcription-FAQs-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Transcription FAQs"></a>YouTube Video Transcription FAQs</h3><h4 id="1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text-3"><a href="#1-How-to-Transcribe-YouTube-Video-to-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

How to Transcribe YouTube Video to Text</h4><p>Usually the transcription files have *.srt extension that are globally accepted and supported by almost all media players. However, there might be instances when you want to have the subtitles in plain text.</p><p>That said, to convert an SRT file to TXT, you can:</p><ul><li>Right-click the <strong>SRT</strong> file</li><li>Go to <strong>Rename</strong></li><li>Replace <strong>srt</strong> with <strong>txt</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on the confirmation box that appears next to convert SRT to TXT</li></ul><p>After this, you can simply double-click the file, and read and modify the transcribed content as needed.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Edit-and-Upload-Edited-Transcript-to-YouTube-3"><a href="#2-How-to-Edit-and-Upload-Edited-Transcript-to-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

In terms of internet it is basically based on the permission of using, copying or distributing content that is available online. YouTube is a video sharing website with its own set of rules and regulations in accordance with its license policy.</p><p>When a user is uploading a video he has option license options that he can choose from. The first option is “standard YouTube License” which means that you grant the broadcasting rights to YouTube. This essentially means that your video can only be accessed from YouTube for watching purpose and cannot be reproduced or distributed in any other form without your consent. The second type of license is the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >“Creative Commons” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>In the below video you’ll learn how to set standard YouTube license and cc license:</p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”"></a>What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”</h2><p>The basic different is that, with a standard license no one can use your video to reproduce as his own work (without clearly marking the video of the original video). However in a standard licence the original video uploader has some right to say “no” to the re-use of his video because the meaning of the video changes altogether.</p><p>However, if you select the creative commons license while uploading then the author may use any portions of work of the original author. It is generally permitted to edit, recompile, change or alter the original work except few listed things. These include copyrights of original work and a clear mentioning that the work has been derived from an original source. Moreover, that the original author will not be held responsible for any damages caused by the derivative work. This is how the two licenses differ from each other.</p><h2 id="3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”"><a href="#3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”" class="headerlink" title="3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?"></a>3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?</h2><ul><li><strong>Is it illegal for me to share Standard YouTube license video with my friends on Facebook?</strong></li></ul><p>It is perfectly alright to share YouTube licensed videos on Facebook or any social media because firstly if sharing was prohibited then probably there wouldn’t have been a share button plug in. Moreover, by clicking share or copy-pasting the URL you are just pointing to the video bearing its original author’s name and URL. Hence, it’s not illegal in any way.</p><ul><li><strong>Can media companies (such as TV show) feature my video without my permission?</strong></li></ul><p>Media companies are generally richly profitable organizations. Hence before using content they need to seek legal permission from the original author of the video. This is especially the case when the owner of the video has used the standard license. It is then mandatory for the media house to take permission from the original video owner who had uploaded the video in the first place.</p><ul><li><strong>Can I use the videos marked as “YouTube standard license” for a non-profit video?</strong></li></ul><p>For a YouTube standard licensed video there is hard and fast legal rule.

YouTube is a video sharing website with its own set of rules and regulations in accordance with its license policy.</p><p>When a user is uploading a video he has option license options that he can choose from. The first option is “standard YouTube License” which means that you grant the broadcasting rights to YouTube. This essentially means that your video can only be accessed from YouTube for watching purpose and cannot be reproduced or distributed in any other form without your consent. The second type of license is the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >“Creative Commons” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>In the below video you’ll learn how to set standard YouTube license and cc license:</p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”-3"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-“Standard-YouTube-License”-and-“Creative-Commons”-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”"></a>What is the difference between “Standard YouTube License” and “Creative Commons”</h2><p>The basic different is that, with a standard license no one can use your video to reproduce as his own work (without clearly marking the video of the original video). However in a standard licence the original video uploader has some right to say “no” to the re-use of his video because the meaning of the video changes altogether.</p><p>However, if you select the creative commons license while uploading then the author may use any portions of work of the original author. It is generally permitted to edit, recompile, change or alter the original work except few listed things. These include copyrights of original work and a clear mentioning that the work has been derived from an original source. Moreover, that the original author will not be held responsible for any damages caused by the derivative work. This is how the two licenses differ from each other.</p><h2 id="3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”-3"><a href="#3-Common-questions-for-“YouTube-standard-license”-3" class="headerlink" title="3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?"></a>3 Common questions for “YouTube standard license”?</h2><ul><li><strong>Is it illegal for me to share Standard YouTube license video with my friends on Facebook?</strong></li></ul><p>It is perfectly alright to share YouTube licensed videos on Facebook or any social media because firstly if sharing was prohibited then probably there wouldn’t have been a share button plug in. Moreover, by clicking share or copy-pasting the URL you are just pointing to the video bearing its original author’s name and URL. Hence, it’s not illegal in any way.</p><ul><li><strong>Can media companies (such as TV show) feature my video without my permission?</strong></li></ul><p>Media companies are generally richly profitable organizations. Hence before using content they need to seek legal permission from the original author of the video. This is especially the case when the owner of the video has used the standard license. It is then mandatory for the media house to take permission from the original video owner who had uploaded the video in the first place.</p><ul><li><strong>Can I use the videos marked as “YouTube standard license” for a non-profit video?</strong></li></ul><p>For a YouTube standard licensed video there is hard and fast legal rule. The original author may claim his work as he has been given certain rights to do so. For a non-profit video yet again you might need to convince him on the fact that you haven’t been gaining anything from usage of his content. So it’s still recommendable to seek permission initially.</p><p>You’ll learn “how to legally use copyrighted music, games, and movies on YouTube” from below video:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Unlock-Google-Meet’s-Potential-on-YouTube-with-This-Guide"><a href="#Unlock-Google-Meet’s-Potential-on-YouTube-with-This-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Unlock Google Meet’s Potential on YouTube with This Guide"></a>Unlock Google Meet’s Potential on YouTube with This Guide</h2><p>Google Meet helps people to connect virtually with each other in a well-protected environment.

Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.</p><p>Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select “Live Streaming.” Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.</p><p>Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the “Start” button. You can see the red “Live” button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session.

However, the <strong>YouTube view monetization programs are</strong> not that clear. Most people don’t even know how YouTube monetization views work. How many views on YouTube do you need to start making money from your content on the platform? Some people have even been made to believe the common misconception that views alone determine the amount of money a YouTuber earns. Let’s have a look at what entails views for YouTube monetization and the factors that affect your earnings on the platform.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>YouTube Channel Grower</strong> A cross-platform for enhancing and editing YouTube videos for more engagement <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Part-1-The-Real-Number-of-YouTube-Views-You-Need-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

The Real Number of YouTube Views You Need to Make Money</strong></h2><p>Despite a lot of people seeking a successful career on YouTube, only a handful make it big on the platform. Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views. Let’s have a look at what YouTube monetization review time involves and the views that get paid.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-1.JPG"                      alt="how many views to earn on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization"><a href="#Eligibility-to-YouTube-Views-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization"></a><strong>Eligibility to YouTube Views Monetization</strong></h3><p>Ideally, you will start earning ad revenue on YouTube for every 100 views on your videos. This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels.

The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers.

Some of the big names like Mr. Beast have proven how lucrative YouTube can be with the right following. However, for newcomers or beginners, succeeding on YouTube is a challenging feat.</p><p>The most burning question is how many monetized views on YouTube do you need to make money? A great deal of creators are still aiming to monetize YouTube views.

This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP).

Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money-1"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095369/26400" target="_top" id="2095369"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095369"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="512"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095369/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>.

Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher’s earnings and competition among rival advertisers.</p><p>And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads. In this case, some advertisers don’t hesitate to pay extra, depending on what they intend to advertise.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples"></a>Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples</h2><p>From pay per 1,000 views to pay per click, understanding the AdSense payment policy is essential if you’re up to monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>Since there’re YouTube AdSense requirements, such as audience demographic, niche, or content, learning about which niche is the lucrative one will also help you decide your next move.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the following examples for better understanding:</p><ul><li>For example, if arts and entertainment is your niche, you can expect to earn <strong>$5.62</strong> after accumulating 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>Creators who create content on vehicles can earn <strong>around $9.20</strong> on every 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>If you’re into beauty and fitness, expect to earn <strong>up to $13.01</strong> on 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>For real estate, health, home, and garden niches, you can earn <strong>$14.50, $17.40</strong>, and $23.35 on every 1,000 pageviews.</li></ul><p>Remember, people from North America can make the most of these earnings.

And focus on creating all elements of your video yourself.</p><p>For YouTube, you can try creating tutorials, do-it-yourself videos, original short films, original music videos, home videos, travel vlogs, or even daily-life vlogs.</p><p>While creating content for YouTube, remember advertisers consider placing ads on more advertiser-friendly content.</p><p>As a blogger, you must provide unique but quality content to exceed AdSense’s eligibility criteria. Having unique content helps Google understand what your website is about. It’s even better if your website provides a one-of-its-kind experience and users visit it again.</p><p>Be it a vlog or blog, please ensure that it’s original and not a copy from other sources.

The videos on the channel are very short but they hit the nail directly on the head so you get to gain knowledge about old Rome and what it was before. Most of the videos are on the wars that were fought but they were also other Roman histories involved. This channel posts videos every week, at least once</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Kings-And-Generals-3"><a href="#5-Kings-And-Generals-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Kings And Generals"></a>5. Kings And Generals</h3><p>This is another good history channel on Youtube, they provide the information through animated historical documentaries. From the channel from the title, you would know that the channel talks mainly in battles and politics, hence the name kings and generals. Aside from the war niche, the videos talk about some of the important happenings in history. The user makes a post on this channel for you to learn about the different kings and generals in history who lost and won their battles and crowns. Videos are posted twice a week</p><h3 id="6-The-Great-War-3"><a href="#6-The-Great-War-3" class="headerlink" title="6. The Great War"></a>6. The Great War</h3><p>This is a channel that has dedicated its time to learning about the great war known as World War 1. The channel shares videos telling the public about the era of World War 1. This is a major part of history and so it is something we ought to learn about. This isn’t just about the soldiers on the battlefield or how the bombs went off to destroy the enemies but it covers everything that happened within that period, from the kind of food they are to the way they dress and the technologies used. Even the different tribes, arts, and cultures. They post videos twice a week</p><h3 id="7-Oversimplified-3"><a href="#7-Oversimplified-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Oversimplified"></a>7. Oversimplified</h3><p>Normally, no one likes the idea of listening or learning from someone who makes things too complicated. Also, when learning, it is more interesting if you could understand it in the best way that you can. Not everything can be learned that way and not everyone can make something that easy to grasp. Channels like oversimplified make things easier for everyone to understand. They oversimplify their contents. They give you histories like the French revolution and the battle of Hastings and make it funnier and twist the storytelling to a way that people would find it interesting and funny sometimes. Videos are posted three times a week</p><h3 id="8-The-History-Guy-2"><a href="#8-The-History-Guy-2" class="headerlink" title="8. The History Guy"></a>8. The History Guy</h3><p>The history guy is known well for the short time he takes in his video. Other history videos online are short but they are much shorter because they take 5 to 15 minutes. Even with this short time, he tends to cover different histories. They are a little bit odd histories but they seem interesting. Things like the wild wide west and the New York blackout that happened in 1977. Other things like how Europeans discovered Alaska and the great olive poisoning that happened in 1919. He makes the videos short because he aims at getting the audience in their spare time. Videos are posted 3 to 4 times a week</p><h3 id="9-Timeline-3"><a href="#9-Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Timeline"></a>9. Timeline</h3><p>This is a timeline popularly on YouTube as the home of world history. What they do here is drop a video once a week that talk about documentaries and other things. They explore around all of ancient Egypt, shedding their whole light on the former dark ages.</p><h3 id="10-Epic-History-TV-3"><a href="#10-Epic-History-TV-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Epic History TV"></a>10. Epic History TV</h3><p>Epic history TV tells you a lot about history and its most important occurrences talking about things like world war one and the epic history of nations like Russia and the story of legends like black beard the pirate. The TV only posts one video every month where you stand a chance to learn about different events that happened in the past.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Misled-by-Fake-History-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Misled-by-Fake-History-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Avoid Being Misled by Fake History"></a>Part 2: How to Avoid Being Misled by Fake History</h2><p>For sure everyone knows the concept of fake news, this is like a rumor that people spread around to implicate those around them. Everyone is well aware that not every news is as authentic as it seems. Relating to the history part, you shouldn’t just go ahead and believe what everyone says on YouTube. Make sure you don’t fall for a fake history story. Sometimes, while trying to avoid fake history, you have to get a mindset that is critical, ensure that the source you get it from is checked, check the story out, take a look at the evidence given, and try to make sure it sounds believable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-leads-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Final-Words-3"><a href="#Final-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Sometimes it might help your mental health if you can take out time to watch some videos on YouTube, it has so many niches so you can choose the ones you like.

This streaming app may also experience some hitches along the way. Remember that even if your phone sync with your YouTube account to upload videos from the “Camera Roll,” YouTube isn’t managed from the Camera Roll but the YouTube app directly. You can solve the issue by signing out of your YouTube account and signing back in.</p><h4 id="2-Connection-Strength-3"><a href="#2-Connection-Strength-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Connection Strength"></a>2) Connection Strength</h4><p>Some videos may appear quite large and cause a time-out during the upload process.

Test your internet speed by searching “internet test speed” on Google. Then click the “Run Speed Test” in the search box. A window will open and give you an estimate of the Mbps that your connection is operating at. If too low, switch to other alternatives.</p><h4 id="3-Verify-your-YouTube-account-3"><a href="#3-Verify-your-YouTube-account-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Verify your YouTube account"></a>3) Verify your YouTube account</h4><p>Verifying your account will help you to enjoy YouTube’s full features.

This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal"><a href="#Audience-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding"><a href="#Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a <strong>green screen background for YouTube videos</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas"><a href="#5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas"></a><strong>5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas</strong></h2><p>It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><ul><li>Snowy Landscape</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-1.png"                      alt="snowy landscape youtube background"                ></p><ul><li>Festive Holiday Decor</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Pro -

This means you will need to save the edited file first on your computer and ensure you use a YouTube supported format. The most effective option is to use the  codec, which will then save your file in the MPEG-4 format. This is the preferred format for YouTube and Video uploads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

These are short, vertical videos that are 60 seconds long. Originally a way of YouTube attempting to compete with TikTok, Shorts have become a household name. However, are YouTube shorts monetized? Can you get paid for YouTube shorts? The increasing interest in monetizing Shorts has inspired many creators working on their video creation. This article answers the question of <strong>can YouTube Shorts be monetized</strong> and explains how the revenue-sharing model works.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Editor</strong> A cross-platform helps creators edit the vertical videos quickly and easily!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

That means achieving a higher ranking can be beneficial for you. YouTube SEO can help you to boost traffic, get more views, and achieve higher rankings. In this article, we’ll explain what YouTube backlinks are and the safest way to get them.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What Are YouTube Backlinks?](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Are YouTube Backlinks Important?](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [A Few More SEO Factors for YouTube SEO](#Part 4)</p><h2 id="What-Are-YouTube-Backlinks"><a href="#What-Are-YouTube-Backlinks" class="headerlink" title="What Are YouTube Backlinks?"></a>What Are YouTube Backlinks?</h2><p>Links between other sites to your YouTube videos are referred to as YouTube backlinks. Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site’s reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.</p><p>The content of a video with more backlinks is seen as more valuable by search engines than those with less, as each backlink adds confidence that the video is worth linking to.</p><p>The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks. Search engines often check popular videos for new backlinks leading to the quick discovery of new content.</p><p>The quality of backlinks significantly impacts the ranking and visibility of a given video. Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.</p><p>Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.</p><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Backlinks-Important"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Backlinks-Important" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Backlinks Important?"></a>Are YouTube Backlinks Important?</h2><p>Yes. Backlinks are one of the vital aspects of SEO. They are essential to ranking well in Google search results, and they also help you stay ahead of your competition.</p><p>Backlinks act as a powerful source to attract your target audience. While getting people to your might be challenging, sending them to your other work is a breeze. You only have to include YouTube backlinks for free to do so. With 65% of people being visual learners, YouTube is a resourceful place for using backlinks.</p><h2 id="How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Backlinks-for-My-Videos"><a href="#How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Backlinks-for-My-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?"></a>How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?</h2><p>Getting high-quality backlinks can be challenging if you don’t know how to do it. The good news is that there are many different methods that you can use to get links that will benefit your YouTube videos; all it takes is a little creativity.</p><p>With that in mind, here are some of the safest ways of getting YouTube backlinks for free for your videos.</p><h4 id="Guest-Vlogging"><a href="#Guest-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Guest Vlogging"></a>Guest Vlogging</h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-1.png"                      alt="Build YouTube Backlink with Guest Vlogging"                ></p><p>If you have a large social media following or even just a few loyal subscribers on YouTube, consider using that to your advantage. Many bloggers and popular vloggers will allow guest appearances in their videos — as long as they also get something out of it. If you are a vlogger in a specific niche, you could guest vlog for someone well-known in your niche, or anyone with higher ranking videos than yours.</p><h4 id="Share-Your-Videos-on-Social-Media"><a href="#Share-Your-Videos-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Share Your Videos on Social Media"></a>Share Your Videos on Social Media</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-2.png"                      alt="Share your youtube video on social media"                ></p><p>Posting original content on social media sites is also a great way to get high-quality backlinks for free. People will click your links, and this can help you to get more views and subscribers too. Many bloggers and vloggers often post the videos they feature on their social media platforms.</p><h4 id="Web-2-0-Sites"><a href="#Web-2-0-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Web 2.0 Sites"></a>Web 2.0 Sites</h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-3.png"                      alt="get youtube backlink via web 2.0 sites"                ></p><p>The use of Web 2.0 sites is a great way to get backlinks for your YouTube videos. Web 2.0 sites, such as Squarespace, Blogger, Blog, Weebly, and WordPress allow you to embed your videos. You can post original content on these sites, which will then link back to yours. So this makes them powerful links indeed.</p><p>Incorporate such websites into your marketing strategy and then target your keywords correctly to get more user engagement. In turn, both your site and embedded video will rank on the top page of search engines, meaning you will rank for that particular search query.</p><h4 id="Pinterest-Video-Pins"><a href="#Pinterest-Video-Pins" class="headerlink" title="Pinterest Video Pins"></a>Pinterest Video Pins</h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-4.png"                      alt="use pinterest video pins to get backlink"                ></p><p>Pinterest video pins are another great option. They are simply a link to your YouTube video placed on the Pinterest site. With over 320 million monthly active users and more than 200 billion pins saved, this is a great way to get YouTube backlinks for free. It also helps you grow your following.</p><p>Creating backlinks using Pinterest video pins can help you tell a story about your brand, idea, or project. Video pins attract and grab the attention of your audience using a cover image. What’s more? You can create video adverts to advertise on Pinterest.</p><h4 id="Unlinked-Mentions"><a href="#Unlinked-Mentions" class="headerlink" title="Unlinked Mentions"></a>Unlinked Mentions</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-5.png"                      alt="unlinked mentiosn for youtube backlinks"                ></p><p>The use of unlinked mentions means that whenever someone writes about a YouTube video without linking it back, you provide them with a link yourself; this is a great way to obtain YouTube backlinks for free.</p><p><strong>●</strong> Questions: Is it safe to buy YouTube backlinks?</p><p><strong>●</strong> No, it is not. You should not buy backlinks because it’s against Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. If you get caught, you will get a Google penalty for trying to cheat the system.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-Few-More-SEO-Factors-for-YouTube-SEO"><a href="#A-Few-More-SEO-Factors-for-YouTube-SEO" class="headerlink" title="A Few More SEO Factors for YouTube SEO"></a>A Few More SEO Factors for YouTube SEO</h2><h4 id="Quality-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Quality-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Quality of Your Videos"></a>Quality of Your Videos</h4><p>YouTube and Google rank high-quality HD videos higher than those of low quality. Use Filmora to create and edit your videos before uploading them to YouTube.</p><p>The software allows you to change the resolution of your videos; it has a range of resolution settings you can choose from to enhance the quality of your videos. You can also adjust the contrast, brightness, tint, and saturation of your videos.</p><p>Moreover, you can cut a section in the middle of a video and remove the shake from videos. Additionally, the program allows you to trim, crop, rotate and join videos.</p><p>The best part is: You don’t need to be tech-savvy to know how to use this software. It is easy to use and has an aesthetically pleasing interface.</p><h5 id="Versatile-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Versatile-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>An easy yet powerful editor</p><p>Numerous effects to choose from</p><p>Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel</p><p>Help you create high-quality YouTube video</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Video-Title"><a href="#Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="Video Title"></a>Video Title</h4><p>The title of your video has a significant effect on your YouTube SEO. Including your target keyword in your title will help your video rank higher. A compelling title also drives a high CTR (click-through rate). However, you should avoid creating clickbait titles, as this can hurt your ranking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-7.png"                      alt="video title of youtube video"                ></p><h4 id="Engagement"><a href="#Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Engagement"></a>Engagement</h4><p>YouTube ranking also depends on how viewers engage with your video. If users watch, share, like, and comment on your videos, Google and YouTube will give them a priority. As such, the more engagement your videos receive, the higher they will rank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-8.png"                      alt="youtube seo factor - engagement"                ></p><h4 id="YouTube-Tags"><a href="#YouTube-Tags" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Tags"></a>YouTube Tags</h4><p>Tags allow YouTube to know what your video is about. For this reason, your first tag should be the target keyword. You should also include variations of the target keyword when adding tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-9.png"                      alt="youtube seo factor - youtube tags"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using these methods can help you gain high-quality links to boost your YouTube SEO and increase views and subscribers to your channel.

Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site’s reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.</p><p>The content of a video with more backlinks is seen as more valuable by search engines than those with less, as each backlink adds confidence that the video is worth linking to.</p><p>The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks. Search engines often check popular videos for new backlinks leading to the quick discovery of new content.</p><p>The quality of backlinks significantly impacts the ranking and visibility of a given video. Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.</p><p>Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.</p><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Backlinks-Important-3"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Backlinks-Important-3" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Backlinks Important?"></a>Are YouTube Backlinks Important?</h2><p>Yes. Backlinks are one of the vital aspects of SEO.

Make Your Text Huge<p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free-2"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep it Clutter-Free"></a>5. Keep it Clutter-Free</h2><p>It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.</p><p>A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For even more tips on making great YouTube thumbnails, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Use these tips to make video thumbnails for YouTube, and tell us what kind of results you get!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>The <strong>video thumbnails</strong> you use for YouTube are vital to getting views and subscribers.
