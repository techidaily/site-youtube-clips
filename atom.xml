However, there are certain regulations and norms by the tech giant - Google that you need to comply with in order to get your wallet stuffed.</p><p>With that said, the following sections explain some of the practical methods to earn money from Google and YouTube and how YouTube Shorts contributes to the process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-on-YouTube-Shorts-Practical-Way-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)"></a>How to Make Money on YouTube Shorts? (Practical Way)</h2><p>The good news is, you are not solely dependent on YouTube Shorts to generate funds from the Internet. In fact, there are several other means that can help you with that. Some of the practical ways that YouTube and Google allow you to earn through include:</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts Fund</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube Shorts Fund is a $100 million fund that is to be distributed from 2021 to 2022. It was introduced in May 2021 as the first step for YouTube Shorts monetization. YouTube Shorts creators that meet the requirements of the fund will receive the bonus.</p><p>To be eligible for the YouTube Shorts Fund bouns, you will need to meet the below requirements.</p><ul><li>Publish one eligible Short in the last 180 days.</li><li>Your channel does not conflict with the YouTube Community Guidelines, copyright rules, or monetization policies.</li><li>Content needs to be original and unique on the YouTube Shorts platform. Uploading movie clips or re-uploading videos from other video platforms are not allowed.</li><li>The creator must be 13 or older.</li><li><strong>Revenue by Advertisement</strong></li></ul><p>With this method, you can have advertisements displayed on your regular YouTube videos. These advertisements help the streaming media generate funds, some part of which is then shared with you. In a broader spectrum, the more videos your YouTube channel has the more money you make.</p><ul><li><strong>Channel Membership</strong></li></ul><p>If you prepare engaging videos that are liked by the majority of users, you can set up your channel for paid members who may get attractive perks in return.</p><ul><li><strong>Merch Shelf</strong></li></ul><p>In this method, you can sell your (or others) branded products to potential customers for monetary gains.</p><ul><li><strong>Influencer</strong></li></ul><p>If you are good at speaking and can motivate people, becoming an influencer is another method you can make a decent amount of money from YouTube with. When you become an influencer, you can get associated with multiple organizations and companies to promote their products and services and get paid.</p><ul><li><strong>Super Chat and Super Stickers</strong></li></ul><p>If you have a good fan base, you can highlight their messages and chat and can charge them for this.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Premium</strong></li></ul><p>You can prepare some engaging and informative videos that are exclusively available for the YouTube Premium members. Because these subscribers have purchased YouTube Premium membership, the streaming platform shares the profit it gets from such users with you.</p><p>The approaches discussed above can help you earn money with YouTube. Now that YouTube has rolled out the plan for YouTube Shorts monetization, we can anticipate more YouTube Shorts monetization in the future. You can also publish your YouTube Shorts video on your channel and the Shorts Shelf. YouTube then suggests these clips to others with similar interests (depending on the keywords that you have added in the description). When such users watch your short videos, the chances are that they would subscribe to your YouTube channel and watch the regular videos that you have already posted, thus helping you make money using any of the methods listed above.</p><p>Another positive aspect of this approach is, the number of views your short videos affects the overall analytics of your YouTube channel (in terms of view count and playback duration), and therefore play a vital role in meeting the minimum requirements as per YouTube policies to get your other, regular YouTube clips monetized.</p><h2 id="Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?"></a>Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?</h2><p>When you start publishing short videos on your YouTube channel, the views that those clips get also affect the total view count and the playback duration of your channel.

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros.

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision-1"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL-1"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched-1"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy-1"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros-1"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros.

You can follow the method given below to learn <strong>how to make YouTube intro</strong> with Filmora:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Add-Intro-Background-to-Filmora"><a href="#Step-1-Add-Intro-Background-to-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Add Intro Background to Filmora"></a>Step 1: Add Intro Background to Filmora</h3><p>Launch Wondershare Filmora, go to <strong>Media</strong> tab at the top, select the <strong>Sample Colors</strong> category from the left pane.</p><p>Notice all the existing solid and gradient colors in the <strong>Media</strong> library in the right, hover the mouse over the tile of the color you want to use as a background, and click the <strong>+</strong> icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sample-colors-media-in-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="use sample colors as intro background"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The default duration of such solids is 5 seconds. You can increase or decrease this time by dragging the right handle of track in the timeline.</p><p>Alternatively, you can also use your own background image or video clip by selecting the <strong>Project Media</strong> category from the left pane, clicking anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window, and then importing your favorite media file to Filmora. After importing, you can follow the procedure given above to add it to the timeline.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Select-and-Add-Audio-Sound-Effect-to-YouTube-Intro"><a href="#Step-2-Select-and-Add-Audio-Sound-Effect-to-YouTube-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Select and Add Audio&#x2F;Sound Effect to YouTube Intro"></a>Step 2: Select and Add Audio&#x2F;Sound Effect to YouTube Intro</h3><p>With audio in the YouTube intro, your video will be more recognizable. If you have watched PewDiePie ‘s video, you’ll find that even though he changed the images on the intro often, he keeps the music and sound the same in the intro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Audio Library"                ></p><p>In Filmora, you can use the music and sound effect in the inbuilt audio library, double click the audio thumbnail from the library to listen to the soundtrack.</p><p>Repeat the process until you find the background music or sound effect that you can use in the intro. Once found, drag and drop it to the audio track below the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-sound-effects-audio-library.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Sound Effect Library"                ></p><p>Note: You should keep the background and the audio at the same duration.

Two of the main platforms are YouTube and Vimeo. This article tells you the difference between both so that you can decide which the best platform is for you. Whether you are a marketer, video producer or gamer you will find the information useful to find your target audience easily.</p><p>Also read:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full Review of Vimeo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Basic, Vimeo Plus or Vimeo Pro: Which is Right for You? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Please watch the video below for more information:</p><h2 id="Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo"></a>Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Communities"><a href="#1-Communities" class="headerlink" title="1  Communities"></a>1  Communities</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> When it comes to users YouTube comes out on top with over a billion views each and every month. You are able to interact with your viewers by using the comments and people are able to follow you so that they are notified of new videos and comments. As there is already a huge following on YouTube it’s easy to get a good following if you have great content. It’s harder to control public content which is a downside to using YouTube and there is very little customer support. With the comments being moderated rarely it can cause a distraction from your video. Businesses tend to internally block YouTube video’s which means you won’t get the viewings from people on their lunch breaks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-vs-youtube-communities.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-vs-youtube-communities"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> With higher quality content and no advertisements video owners can quickly build a valid following and gain comments from people that are contributing high value information. You have more detailed analytics which makes it easier to see where you are going wrong should you not have the following you want and you are able to use your own domain. With Google owning YouTube you are unlikely to get the same exposure you would, however the followers tend to be valid giving you a real idea of where you are going right or wrong. Because of the higher quality followers you are less likely to get negative or abusive comments when you use Vimeo, however it is a paid subscription with each tier giving you more space to upload.</p><h4 id="2-Membership"><a href="#2-Membership" class="headerlink" title="2  Membership"></a>2  Membership</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube on the other hand is free for all to use because the main focus is getting their equity through advertisements. There is however the option to take out a subscription which is known as YouTube Red. This lets you watch as many video’s as you want without having to view the ads and also gets you the ability to download so you don’t have to go online to view your favourite videos, a music app and original programming facilities.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> There are 4 different membership options with Vimeo allowing you to tailor it to your needs; there is the basic, plus, pro and business.

With Vimeo if you need to update a video you can do so without losing the statistics it has already gained, which is great news if you notice an error later down the line or need to add or take something away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-uploading.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-uploading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes down to making the final decision between using YouTube or Vimeo you will need to look at the type of audience you want to attract.

Instagram jumped on the short-form standing video bandwagon with its Reels and Stories features, and Facebook cloned the same format as Facebook Stories.</p><p>Thus, the trend of vertical video exploded during the pandemic.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is an infant feature that allows creators to upload short-form vertical videos to the platform, adding various TikTok-like enhancements, from colorful text to images to different music additions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shortsu-fund.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts F</strong> <strong>und</strong> is identical related to YouTube Shorts. This is quite an interesting concept to study as it’s associated with the vast platform.</p><p>The best part of YouTube Shorts? YouTube has signaled their attention to help creators monetize Shorts and transform them into a solid news revenue stream. To that concern, the company has decided to pay creators at least <strong>$100 million</strong> for their YouTube Shorts monetization through 2022.</p><p>Here we are going to introduce you how to make money on YouTube Shorts and some monetization tips. Just watch the below video.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: What’s YouTube Shorts Fund?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How to Join&#x2F;Apply for YouTube Shorts Fund?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: How to Claim Bonus Payment from YouTube Shorts Fund?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: FAQs about YouTube Shorts Fund</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s YouTube Shorts Fund?"></a>Part 1: What’s YouTube Shorts Fund?</h2><p>The <strong>YouTube Shorts Fund</strong> is a part of the YouTube Shorts monetization scheme. It’s a $100M fund distributed throughout 2021 - 2022.</p><p>As per YouTube’s official website source, anyone can participate in the fund simply by creating unique and engaging Shorts that delight the community of YouTube to a great extent.</p><p>Each month, YouTube reaches multiples of creators whose Shorts received the most views and engagement to reward them for their contributions. YouTube also asks the creators to share their feedback to continue enhancing the overall product experience. So, this activity relates to the YouTube Shorts Fund eligibility.</p><p>However, this YouTube Shorts Fund is generally not limited to just the YouTube Partner Program creators. Such creators will be eligible to participate if they adhere to all the Community Guidelines and create only original content for Shorts.</p><p>Moreover, YouTube kept sharing additional details as they got closer to the same concept.</p><h3 id="The-Future-of-Monetization-on-Shorts"><a href="#The-Future-of-Monetization-on-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Monetization on Shorts"></a>The Future of Monetization on Shorts</h3><p>As discussed earlier, the YouTube Shorts Fund is the first step in their journey to build YouTube Shorts, a monetization model.</p><p>Even YouTube is excited to begin rewarding creators for their contributions via the YouTube Shorts Fund. On the same note, they’ll expand their Shorts player across various YouTube surfaces to assist people in looking for new artists, creators, and Shorts to enjoy.</p><p>All in all, YouTube has helped an entire generation of artists and creators turn their creativity into businesses with the YouTube Shorts Fund. YouTube has paid $30 billion-plus money to artists, creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years. They remain deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators while introducing the YouTube Shorts Fund.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-Apply-for-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-Apply-for-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Join&#x2F;Apply for YouTube Shorts Fund?"></a>Part 2: How to Join&#x2F;Apply for YouTube Shorts Fund?</h2><p>First, know that every creator on the platform is eligible to know the YouTube Shorts fund eligibility.</p><p>Your channel has to comply with a strict set of eligibility requirements to activate the YouTube Shorts monetization.</p><p>Your channel has to have multiples of subscribers and four thousand hours of watch time to join the YouTube Partner Program. However, the case is quite different when it comes to YouTube Shorts eligibility.</p><p>The YouTube Shorts Fund only has a single requirement of eligibility criteria to know how to join the YouTube Shorts fund. You have to create original yet lovely content for the viewers.</p><p>You don’t have to be the YouTube Partner Program’s part, nor does your channel have to meet its requirements for monetization. The Shorts Fund is open to each creator.</p><p><strong>YouTube will directly reach out to creators about the fund.</strong></p><p>So far, there’s not a direct way of application for the YouTube Shorts Fund. Creators can’t request an invitation or enroll themselves in the fund. The only way you can join the fund is via a direct YouTube invitation.</p><p>YouTube will divide this fund from the Shorts Fund on a rolling basis. The creators who’ve received the highest amounts of views and engagement levels on their YouTube Shorts will receive the rewards. They plan to reach out to multiples of creators each month.</p><p><strong>It will help if you keep creating great content to prepare for the YouTube Shorts fund.</strong></p><p>The best way you can create is to keep uploading excellent content. You can use this time to become a pro at creating compelling YouTube Shorts among the broader audience base. It would help to grow your audience with Shorts so that your YouTube channel will be present on YouTube’s radar.</p><p>The YouTube Shorts Fund is an ideal opportunity for creators of all sizes to activate YouTube Shorts monetization.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Claim-Bonus-Payment-from-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Claim-Bonus-Payment-from-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Claim Bonus Payment from YouTube Shorts Fund?"></a>Part 3: How to Claim Bonus Payment from YouTube Shorts Fund?</h2><p>To know how to claim YouTube Shorts Fund or bonus, you’re required to go through the following two steps:</p><ul><li>Accept the terms</li><li>Link an active AdSense account</li></ul><p>Creators who do not have an AdSense account will be able to set one up directly on YouTube as part of the procedure of claiming. Once you claim your YouTube Shorts fund or bonus payment successfully, that amount will get added to your monthly cost of AdSense.</p><p>It is worth defining that channels creating and publishing non-original content, videos re-uploaded from other channels, and videos with the logos or watermarks from third-party social platforms will not be eligible to claim a bonus payment from the YouTube Shorts Fund.</p><p>In addition to the YouTube Shorts Fund, YouTube provides numerous other methods in which creators can earn more revenues from their YouTube content and build their businesses on the platform. These consist of merchandise, ads, YouTube BrandConnect, and channel memberships, among others.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-about-YouTube-Shorts-Fund"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-about-YouTube-Shorts-Fund" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs about YouTube Shorts Fund"></a>Part 4: FAQs about YouTube Shorts Fund</h2><p>Here are some common questions about YouTube Shorts Fund for your reference.</p><h4 id="1-How-do-YouTube-Shorts-go-viral"><a href="#1-How-do-YouTube-Shorts-go-viral" class="headerlink" title="1.

It could be an excellent manner to activate YouTube Shorts fund monetization or build an income stream for your channel and a new subscriber base.</p><p>If you’ve never used YouTube before, that’s an even great reason to give YouTube Shorts a try. Diving into YouTube can sometimes be challenging — with a potentially broad reach and day-one monetization, YouTube provides unheard-of perks to the creators of new Shorts.</p><p>Most people probably wouldn’t get attracted if any other company launched a new short-form vertical video platform. But because Shorts comes from a platform like YouTube — which has a long history of a massive audience, creator-friendly scenarios, and the power of Google backing it up — the new platform is a must-try for any video creator and creative individual. And, the addition of $100 million YouTube Shorts fund in financial support is a lot of delicious icing on the cake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-explore-the-power-of-pip-on-modern-edge-browser/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Explore the Power of PIP on Modern Edge Browser</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-choosing-the-right-format-boosting-your-youtube-videos-performance/"><u>[New] Choosing the Right Format – Boosting Your YouTube Videos’ Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-enhance-your-instagram-stories-with-a-blend-of-pictures-a-beginners-guide/"><u>[New] Enhance Your Instagram Stories with a Blend of Pictures A Beginner's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-optimal-filter-pack-for-oceanic-video-shooting/"><u>[Updated] Optimal Filter Pack for Oceanic Video Shooting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-advanced.techidaily.com/44cm44ow44op44km44k244ky44o844og44gu44oq44ki44or44k44kk44og5ypluso6yyy44gm5yplusv6io944gq5pya5paw44k944ov44oi44go44gd44gu5l244ge5pa544cn/"><u>「ブラウザゲームのリアルタイム収録が可能な最新ソフトとその使い方」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/a-quick-guide-to-infinix-zero-5g-2023-turbo-frp-bypass-instantly-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Quick Guide to Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP Bypass Instantly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/enhancing-shadows-in-iphone-video-with-ease/"><u>Enhancing Shadows in Iphone Video with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-ensuring-legitimacy-of-your-youtube-sign-in/"><u>In 2024, Ensuring Legitimacy of Your YouTube Sign-In</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-strategies-for-viewing-your-subscribers/"><u>In 2024, Essential Strategies for Viewing Your Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/mastering-youtube-brand-visuals-the-ultimate-creation-guide/"><u>Mastering YouTube Brand Visuals The Ultimate Creation Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/pixie-dust-game-hours-childrens-choice-edition-for-2024/"><u>Pixie-Dust Game Hours - Children's Choice Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/top-7-skype-hacker-to-hack-any-skype-account-on-your-nubia-red-magic-8s-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 7 Skype Hacker to Hack Any Skype Account On your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-lag-in-nier-blue-ruin-top-solutions-explored/"><u>Troubleshooting Lag in Nier: Blue Ruin - Top Solutions Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-advantages-4-reasons-to-prefer-claude-3/"><u>Unveiling the Advantages: 4 Reasons to Prefer Claude 3</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There is a fantastic quote, credited to bestselling author, <a class="link"   href="https://acuff.me/" >Jon Acuff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that goes:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fantastic-quote-do-not-compare-beginning-to-middle.jpg"                      alt="fantastic quote"                ></p><p>While researching your competition, you will feel overwhelmed, but remember, you are at the beginning, and Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver are not even at their middle, they are way passed the finish line. You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p><p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p><p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p><p>- To be entertained</p><p>- To learn something new</p><p>- To be inspired</p><p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p><p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p><p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p><p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p><p>Want to know more thumbnail maker?

You are almost there… but not there yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.filmora.io/5/XDyocwuGRiSptxueJZ5aokKqKt-JXMbX.gif"                      alt="XDyocwuGRiSptxueJZ5aokKqKt-JXMbX"                ></p><p>Come on, keep going!</p><h4 id="Step-10-Fill-Out-Your-Videos-Assets"><a href="#Step-10-Fill-Out-Your-Videos-Assets" class="headerlink" title="Step 10: Fill Out Your Videos Assets"></a>Step 10: Fill Out Your Videos Assets</h4><p>The video is done, the thumbnail is designed, and you have all your title, description, and tags ready to go. This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creator-stuido-fill-out-video-assets.jpg"                      alt="Fill Out Your Videos Assets"                ></p><h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p><p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p><p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p><p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p><p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p><p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p><p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p><p>Besides considering YouTube SEO, you should make a good YouTube video as well.

In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.</p><p>However, in as much as <strong>YouTube speed control</strong> slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.</p><p>Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.</p><p>If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can <strong>fast forward YouTube</strong> video by using the feature.</p><p>Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this <strong>YouTube speed control</strong>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>YouTube speed control</strong> has made it easier to change <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Maximizing-Your-Reach-with-YouTube-Shorts-Templates"><a href="#Maximizing-Your-Reach-with-YouTube-Shorts-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Maximizing Your Reach with YouTube Shorts Templates"></a>Maximizing Your Reach with YouTube Shorts Templates</h2><p>YouTube Shorts are short, 60-second videos that can be shared across all social media platforms.

Does Sub4Sub Work?"></a>1. Does Sub4Sub Work?</h4><p> The technical answer is ‘yes’. You can get new subscribers quickly using sub for sub and it is in no way against YouTube’s rules. On the other hand, subscribers gained through sub for sub do not watch or share your videos. Users end up with more subscribers, but their channels do not truly grow.</p><h4 id="2-Pros-of-Sub4Sub"><a href="#2-Pros-of-Sub4Sub" class="headerlink" title="2. Pros of Sub4Sub"></a>2. Pros of Sub4Sub</h4><p> A big part of doing well on YouTube is being engaged in your vlogging community. If a YouTuber with a similar topic to yours approaches you with a Sub4Sub request and you engage them in a conversation it could be the beginning of a great friendship. Beyond subscribing to each other you can share tips, comment on each other’s videos, and maybe even collaborate on a video someday.</p><p> Sub4Sub can also help some YouTubers with their confidence. It can be discouraging not to see any growth and being embarrassed over their low subscriber counts can result in vloggers deciding to hide that information. They may feel like their content is being judged badly by people who are not even watching their videos based on how few subscribers they have. Building up a higher number using Sub4Sub may allow some YouTubers to move past these concerns and get back to focusing on making good videos.</p><h4 id="3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub"><a href="#3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub" class="headerlink" title="3. Cons of Sub4Sub"></a>3. Cons of Sub4Sub</h4><p> The reality is that if people are pre-judging your videos based on your stats it is not subscribers they are looking at so much as views. Sub4Sub helps you get subscribers, but in most cases those subscribers will never watch any of your videos. They will also never share them or tell their friends to watch them, the way subscribers gained organically will. So while your subscriber count goes up, your view count stays low.</p><p> The situation described in the Pros section, where you talk to each other and comment on each other’s videos, is rare. You are more likely to make friends with other YouTubers after you have already watched each other’s videos or after chatting in a forum. It is worth trying to engage a vlogger with a similar topic to yours if they ask you to sub for sub, but most people who ask will have no intention of interacting with you beyond subscribing to each other. Realistically if you are going to use sub for sub to increase your subscriber count by any significant number you will not have time to have actual conversations with everyone you approach, or to watch their videos.</p><p> When you agree to exchange subscriptions with somebody there is also the danger that they will decide to unsubscribe from your channel afterwards. This could happen much later when they realize they do not want to be subscribed to so many people and have forgotten which channels were parts of Sub4Sub agreements. Or it could happen within weeks, days, or even hours of you subscribing to them. There are some dishonest YouTubers who use sub for sub to get subscribers while already planning to unsubscribe to anybody who agrees. Their hope is that the other person will not notice or will not bother unsubscribing from them if they do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Sometimes YouTubers with smaller channels feel like their small subscriber counts are holding them back.

Available Google Workspace Edition"></a>1. Available Google Workspace Edition</h3><p>For <strong>Google Meet YouTube live</strong>, there are some requirements. The reason is that not every ordinary user of Google Meet can go for YouTube live streaming. To do so, you should buy any of the following pricing plans:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Google Workspace Pricing Plan</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Enterprise Starter</td><td>Approx. $10&#x2F;User&#x2F;Month</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Standard</td><td>Approx. $20&#x2F;User&#x2F;Month</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Plus</td><td>Approx. $30&#x2F;User&#x2F;Month</td></tr><tr><td>Education Plus</td><td>Approx. $5&#x2F;Student&#x2F;Month</td></tr><tr><td>Teaching and Learning Upgrade</td><td>Approx. $4&#x2F;License&#x2F;Month</td></tr><tr><td>Workspace Individual Subscriber</td><td>Approx. $9.9&#x2F;Month</td></tr><tr><td>Google One Subscribers with 2 TB or More Storage Space</td><td>Approx. $10&#x2F;Month</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075483/7443" target="_top" id="2075483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note:</strong> To know the exact pricing plans of Google Workspace, you have to contact Google Support.</p><h3 id="2-Approval-of-YouTube-Channel-for-Live-1"><a href="#2-Approval-of-YouTube-Channel-for-Live-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live"></a>2. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live</h3><p>To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel’s YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:</p><p>Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the “Profile” icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the “YouTube Studio” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the youtube studio option"                ></p><p>Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen. From the left panel, select “Content” among other options. Under the section called “Live,” locate the “Get Started” option. Afterward, tap on the “Request” option and perform the verification steps for enabling live streaming. After 24 hours, you would get approval for live streaming on YouTube. Hence, you would be able to live stream Google Meet meetings through your YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on get ting started option"                ></p><h3 id="3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet-1"><a href="#3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet"></a>3. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet</h3><p>Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.</p><p>Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the <strong>Google Meet live stream</strong> on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube"></a>Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube</h2><p>Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, you can start a live stream from Google Meet to YouTube. Check the following steps to execute the process:</p><p>Step1 To allow Google Meet sessions to live stream on YouTube, the Google Workspace admin must adjust some settings. To begin, log in to the “Admin Console” on the Workspace administrator account. Now go to “Apps” and access the “Google Workspace” option.</p><p>Step2 Afterward, click “Google Meet” and tap on the “Stream” option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options “Let People Steam Their Meetings” and “Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings.” Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.</p><p>Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.</p><p>Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select “Live Streaming.” Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.</p><p>Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the “Start” button. You can see the red “Live” button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session. Once you have concluded the live streaming by clicking on the “Stop Streaming” button, you can check the video analytics by visiting your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream-1"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream"></a>Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream</h2><p>Do you want to save your <strong>Google Meet live-stream session</strong>?

Have a Consistent Layout"></a>1. Have a Consistent Layout</h2><p>Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.</p><p>An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg"                      alt="Consistent Layout"                ></p><h2 id="2-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#2-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Your Face"></a><strong>2. Use Your Face</strong></h2><p>People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more tips like this here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic"><a href="#3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.</p><p>Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#4-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Your Text Huge"></a>4. Make Your Text Huge</h2><p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free" class="headerlink" title="5.

Getting people to watch them is the next and a much bigger obstacle in your path. Just as a blogger must work hard to get people to read their blog, so a YouTuber needs to find ways to get more views on their videos.</p><p>For any piece of content on the internet, discoverability is key to exposure. After all, nobody will watch your video or read your blog if they can’t find it, right? A blogger would do this by lacing their content with SEO - search engine optimization. But how can a YouTuber do the same? The answer lies in something known as YouTube tags optimization.

You need to specify the type of video. In other words, you need to describe your video with keywords. But you might think about why you need to add these words. YouTube can’t figure out what my videos are about? Unfortunately, YouTube can’t though its algorithm is much more advanced than before.</p><p>You must know the competition between videos is furious since <a class="link"   href="https://tubularinsights.com/hours-minute-uploaded-youtube/" >500 hours of video per minute are uploaded on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this case, it is important to let the YouTube algorithm know your video by adding related tags to have a higher ranking. So the better tags we choose, the higher chance to rank in the top 1, which means you will get more views!</p><p>Using YouTube meta tags wisely can broaden your reach and help new people discover your content. However, don’t be tempted to insert irrelevant tags just because you know they are high traffic. You will be found out and penalized as a result. Just as you did with your description, research your keywords, place the most important ones first and use as many as you can.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types"><a href="#What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types" class="headerlink" title="What are the three YouTube tag types?"></a>What are the three YouTube tag types?</h3><p>YouTube has three different types of tags and each of them has a specific purpose. The tags are-</p><p><strong>Specific</strong> – The specific tag types are keywords-oriented. These keywords specifically pertain to the content of your video. In this tag type, the particular video is highlighted with the keyword tags. Often while typing the keywords in your mind, YouTube suggests phrases and keywords according to the content of your video. You may apply the suggestions and also add more general or common versions of the same keywords.</p><p><strong>Compound</strong> – The compound tags are usually using more than two words. Many a time it is seen that users prefer tagging the complete title of the video. If you are using your video title as the compound tag, ensure that you do not include the prepositions like or, as, and, etc. This is because YouTube allows just 500 characters in the title and ignore the prepositions. It is always advised to use all the 500 characters YouTube has allowed without wasting the characters on prepositions as it will automatically be ignored.</p><p><strong>Generic</strong> – The generic tags are the ones that describe the entire video in one or two words. These tags are used in all the videos of yours. These tags are used across your channel for all the videos you post. It is important to have such general constant tags.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them"></a>Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them</h2><p>The more relevant tags you add, the better it is. The best part is YouTube doesn’t restrict the number of tags but adding all is not possible and adding something irrelevant doesn’t make sense. So, your YouTube video tags must be the smart ones for more views. Educated tagging is what is required.</p><p>1. <strong>Brand-Specific Tags Addition</strong> - Every business wants their brand name to show up in the search results on YouTube and Google. Self-referencing your video or tagging your brand name in a number of variations is a smart way of letting others know your brand.</p><p>2. <strong>Using YouTube Auto Suggest</strong> – Play with the search option on YouTube and check out the YouTube suggestions when you search. Try to recognize the common videos that pop up while searching for something important and relevant to yours. Try searching for random keywords according to your YouTube search experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-suggest.jpg"                      alt="youtube auto suggest"                ></p><p>3. <strong>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/" >YouTube Keyword Search Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – Lastly, you may use the YouTube keyword suggestion tool. It helps you to extract the relevant keywords from the videos of your competitors and create suggestions according to the basic term provided by you.</p><p>4. <strong>Use Specific Tags</strong> - After using tools, you need to narrow down your tags specifically, like tags “learn 3D paper cutting”. The search volume may not be huge, but these kinds of tags can let YouTube know your video very well. Give it a try!</p><p>5. <strong>Check competitor’s Tags</strong> - When you check tags from other brands, it is not suggested to copy them all. What you need to do is find what you are missing and try to cover that area. However, only third-party tools can help you do that. In the market, <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is highly used. It has a free version.

You can use singular and plural tags. Sometimes remember to add some misspelling tags because users tend to mistype some words, so it’s better to cover this kind of tag.

It helps people search for your video, helps YouTube to categorize it correctly and, when done well, can broaden the reach of your content. YouTube meta consists of three main parts: tags, title and description. Here’s how you can use each of these three elements to create powerful metadata for your video:</p><h3 id="1-Title"><a href="#1-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Title"></a>1. Title</h3><p>YouTube titles play a big part in the ranking factors for search. That means you’ve got to think about what the people most likely to want to see your video will type into the search bar, as well as the words that accurately describe your video.</p><p>For example, if you have a clip of your cat Fluffy climbing a tree, calling your video ‘Fluffy climbs a tree’ is not the best idea. Nobody knows who Fluffy is; it could be your rabbit, dog, daughter or feather duster for all the YouTube community knows, and nobody is going to be searching for it.</p><p>A better title would be ‘cat climbs a tree, but you could even improve on that. How about ‘funny cat climbs a tree’, which would capture all those people looking for funny cat videos. Or, even better, ‘funny Persian cat climbs a tree’, also capturing those people who adore Persian cats.</p><p>You can see how building awesome YouTube titles can happen organically like this, but it’s also worth doing your homework too. We have collected a handful of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to improve your YouTube meta, so check out the suggestions and work forwards from there.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Research your keywords and include high traffic keywords at the start of the title</li><li>Keep titles under 70 characters</li><li>Branding, episode number, and other non-essential info should be at the end of the title</li><li>Review your YouTube titles from time to time and update with new keywords as search trends change</li><li>Avoid clickbait titles or misleading titles as this will affect your view time and subsequently your ranking in search</li></ul><h3 id="2-Description"><a href="#2-Description" class="headerlink" title="2. Description"></a>2. Description</h3><p>Your description is a much longer piece of YouTube meta, so you can really go to town with your YouTube keywords here. You’ve got up to 5,000 characters to fill in, and we strongly advise that you aim to use every single one. This really is a golden opportunity, not only to get people motivated to watch all of your video, but also to be indexed correctly through well researched YouTube keywords.</p><p>You may have noticed that, on the search page itself, only a small part of the description actually shows up; 120 characters of it to be precise. This doesn’t affect indexing, but it does mean you have to plan your YouTube description carefully to really hook people into clicking through from just the first sentence or two.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Make the first sentence or two compelling and captivating to get people to click</li><li>Research the best YouTube keywords to use to ensure your video is correctly indexed</li><li>At the end of your YouTube description, include a call to action to direct viewers on what to do next (subscribe, click through to the website, look at a product, watch more videos, etc.)</li><li>If your video is long, consider placing time codes in your description to help users jump to their areas of interest</li><li>Add links to products showcased, your social channels, or website as you wish</li><li>Don’t forget to credit any music you’ve used here</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141680/17091" target="_top" id="2141680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141680/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description"></a>Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description</h2><p>So, now we’ve got the basics down, let’s move on to some top tips for getting your metadata just right:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Do not spam</strong></li></ul><p>Irrelevant keywords will not do you any favors in the long run. Using a popular search term such as ‘funny cat’ when actually it’s a video of you unboxing your product will simply irritate your viewers. You’ll get more views, but for shorter durations, and that will hurt not only your ranking but also your reputation. The people you want to draw in with your YouTube meta should be those who are genuinely interested in your videos, as these are the people who will share, comment and interact with you.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Don’t put tags in the description</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube has given you a place to put your tags, and that’s not in the description area of your meta. Placing tags in the description area is known as tag stuffing and can lead to videos being removed or penalized.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Update regularly</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube meta is not a static thing. Trends change, search statistics fluctuate, and the needs of your viewers alter as time goes on. For this reason, you should look to update your meta from time to time, at least once every six months or so. Re-research your keywords and optimize for today’s trending search terms.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube SEO Complete Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148642/16836" target="_top" id="2148642">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148642" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="50"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148642/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Take some time to perfect your meta on YouTube and see how many more views it helps you get.

The success of your YouTube videos will largely depend on your ability to optimize your videos so they are ranked in people’s search results. People can’t fall in love with your videos they never stumble across them.</p><p>If you optimize your titles, tags, and descriptions to include relevant keywords you will see much better traffic from Google as well as from YouTube’s search results. Here are some tips:</p><h2 id="Find-the-Best-Keywords"><a href="#Find-the-Best-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Find the Best Keywords"></a>Find the Best Keywords</h2><p>One of the most important steps to ensuring SEO success is to identify the keywords that you should be using.</p><p>You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner" >Google keyword planner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find keywords related to your video’s topic. Input one of your competitors’ video links to detect some of the top searches that were used to find the video. The keyword planner will scan through the top searches for that video link and determine the keywords that are used most often.</p><p>The keyword list can be a bit overwhelming the first time. Remember to use keywords that get at least 300 searches per month on Google. Using popular keywords will help you match up against competitors in your niche.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-Titles-Descriptions-and-Tags"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-Titles-Descriptions-and-Tags" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your Titles, Descriptions, and Tags"></a>How to Optimize Your Titles, Descriptions, and Tags</h2><p>Your keyword research will help you craft title, description, and tags of your videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-YouTube-Titles"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-YouTube-Titles" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize YouTube Titles"></a>How to Optimize YouTube Titles</h2><p>The ideal YouTube title intrigues the potential viewer, drawing them in and making them want to click the link.</p><p>A video title should include your most important keyword. Usually, your most important keyword will be the first word in your title.

Some of the top rules that you should consider with tags are; using 8-12 in every video and making sure the top keyword you used in your title is included as a tag.</p><p>Tags on previous videos can also be rearranged and edited as you do keyword research.

In our guide, you will find an answer to this, along with related queries like how YouTube highlighted comment works, the removal process, its benefits, and more.</p><p>If you own a YouTube channel or are starting one, even you can do this. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the core of YouTube’s highlighted comments. We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter. If a reply comment (HR) gets highlighted, the parent comment gets raised to the top.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-2-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?"></a>Part 2: What Does The Highlighted Comment Look Like?</h2><p>YouTube has been working on improving the navigation of the comment section for videos, and highlighted comments are one of them. These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video.

Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it.

The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously).

It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial.

Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel.

Unless you garner deep insights of your competitors. You must be thinking how can you gauge their company insights using YouTube and track the data movement as well. There is nothing to worry about, we have got you covered. We will show you how to analyze your own channel as well as that of your competitors’ YouTube analytics. Let’s now explore about it!</p><h2 id="How-to-analyze-your-own-YouTube-channel-video"><a href="#How-to-analyze-your-own-YouTube-channel-video" class="headerlink" title="How to analyze your own YouTube channel&#x2F;video?"></a>How to analyze your own YouTube channel&#x2F;video?</h2><p> It is important to have reliable YouTube analytics tools for your brand, as videos on YouTube are searchable through Google. They contribute to generate organic traffic for you using both Google and YouTube as a medium. YouTube has a default dedicated analytics mechanism to measure how the video fares in YouTube to gain the most out of it.</p><p> Here we have collated the broadly used YouTube insights to ensure that your highly equipped, SEO compatible video engages more audience and performs well. The matrix sums up the most essential parts of YouTube analytics. Let’s go through them.</p><h4 id="1-Views"><a href="#1-Views" class="headerlink" title="1.  Views"></a>1.  Views</h4><p> Though, views determine the number of people clicked on a certain video on YouTube, it’s impossible to figure out whether the video has been watched till the end or not. Moreover, they can be altered through clickbait tricks and hence YouTube doesn’t solely put much value on them.</p><p> Views along with watch time turn out to be the best bet. Watch time sums up the total amount of time spent (in terms of minutes) on your brand’ videos. With the updated dashboard it becomes easy to get the YouTube analytics and gauge the video’s performance. Using the average view duration, you can know whether your video is being watched till the end or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-views.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="2-Playback-Location"><a href="#2-Playback-Location" class="headerlink" title="2.  Playback Location"></a>2.  Playback Location</h4><p> As ‘Playback locations’ of YouTube videos can reveal where does all the traffic come from, it would help your channel figure out for which location the video has fared well. It will guide you to reach the backlinks locations&#x2F;sites. Knowing the popular locations for your YouTube video being played, you can know whether YouTube is the search engine or they have been diverted from somewhere else. Depending on the video playing locations, the views will be segregated in to embedded video, YouTube watch page, mobile devices, and YouTube channel page. Understanding location specific views would help you decide where should you focus to enhance the performance of your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-playback-location.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="3-Demographics"><a href="#3-Demographics" class="headerlink" title="3.

Traffic sources"></a>4.  Traffic sources</h4><p> Understanding the source of your YouTube video’s traffic would help you track the prominent keywords that viewers use for landing at your YouTube video. You can figure out their choice and their search patterns this way.

Likes and dislikes"></a>7.  Likes and dislikes</h4><p> YouTube insights gauge the audience acceptance for your video by the number of likes and dislikes. Videos with a huge number of like implies that it is loved by people, though, the quality of video can’t exactly be defined by the number of likes or dislikes.

YouTube gamers are among some of the most popular vloggers on YouTube. To be a successful YouTube gamer you need have both gaming skills and a great vlogging presence.</p><p>Posting a cool gaming videos once in a while for your friends is fun, and if that is all you want to do then the first tip on this list should help you out. If you are hoping to build a popular YouTube channel centered on gaming then you will want to read further. Gaming vlogs are more than just hobbies for successful YouTube gamers. They put a lot of work into them.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about being a gaming vlogger is that gameplay footage is protected by copyright. Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games. There will usually be information on the manufacturer’s website, often in the ‘Terms of Use’ section, which explains their policy. If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p><hr><p>Looking for a good video editor for your gaming video? Wondershare Filmora is recommended. It is not just a video editor which allows you to cut, split, add text, apply background sound to your video clips, but also a screen recorder which helps you record videos from PC screem webcam, and voice over. What’s more, you can find lots of special effects for gaming in this software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p>&lt;2&gt; Four tips for YouTube gamers:</p><h4 id="1-Equipment"><a href="#1-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="1. Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"                      alt="gamer elgato"                ></p><p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p><p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p><p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p><p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p><h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p><p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p><h4 id="3-Time-Management"><a href="#3-Time-Management" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p><p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p><p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p><h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p><p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p><p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums. You need to participate in conversations and take an interest in people if you want them to take an interest in you and your work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-charting-the-course-to-trending-youtubers/"><u>[New] Charting the Course to Trending YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-unleash-potential-superior-strategies-for-personalized-facebook-profiles-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unleash Potential Superior Strategies for Personalized Facebook Profiles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-foundations-of-video-editing-in-the-gaming-world/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Foundations of Video Editing in the Gaming World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-chuckle-chronicles-top-10-humoristic-youtube-video-plans/"><u>[Updated] Chuckle Chronicles Top 10 Humoristic YouTube Video Plans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-convincing-audiences-to-join-a-positive-approach/"><u>[Updated] Convincing Audiences to Join A Positive Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-spark-joy-with-these-14-playful-text-animations/"><u>[Updated] Spark Joy with These 14 Playful Text Animations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-guide-exploring-every-nook-and-cranny-of-stardew-valley-particularly-ginger-island/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Guide Exploring Every Nook and Cranny of Stardew Valley, Particularly Ginger Island</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-addressing-crashes-of-microsoft-edge-browser-in-windows-11/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Addressing Crashes of Microsoft Edge Browser in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/how-to-easily-batch-convert-flac-files-to-wav-audio-format-on-your-pc/"><u>How to Easily Batch Convert FLAC Files to WAV Audio Format on Your PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/maximizing-youtube-earnings-master-the-art-with-500-subscribers/"><u>Maximizing YouTube Earnings Master the Art with 500 Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/quick-start-guide-bavarder-in-linux-environment/"><u>Quick-Start Guide: Bavarder in Linux Environment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/supercharged-communication-advanced-features-in-whatsapp-for-2024/"><u>Supercharged Communication Advanced Features in WhatsApp for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/the-language-labyrinth-journey-through-the-verbal-cosmos-of-star-wars/"><u>The Language Labyrinth: Journey Through the Verbal Cosmos of Star Wars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-videographers-accessory-list-the-top-9-essentials/"><u>The Ultimate Videographer’s Accessory List - The Top 9 Essentials</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075462/7443" target="_top" id="2075462">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075462" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075462/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Businesses use FameBit to find the perfect video creators – or ‘digital influencers’ – to help with their marketing campaigns.</p><p>Until your channel is huge it is difficult to make a significant amount of money through ad revenue on YouTube. Creating branded content is one way in which YouTubers with small or mid-sized channels can generate income.</p><p>Finding sponsorships and negotiating with brands can be tricky. So can integrating products and brand messages in your videos without making your audience feel like you have ‘sold out’. This guide will help.</p><p>You must have at least 5,000 subscribers to join FameBit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-famebit-find-youtube-sponsorship.jpg"                      alt="Use FameBit to Find YouTube Sponsorship"                ></p><h2 id="How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Can You Make"></a>How Much Money Can You Make</h2><p>How much money you can make on FameBit will depend on the deals you can negotiate with brands, and those deals will depend on how many subscribers you have and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how many views you usually receive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>When calculating your fee, FameBit suggests thinking of it in terms of ‘cost per view’ (CPV). Most creators on FameBit charge between $0.05 and $0.10 per view. If you charge $0.05 per view and you get an average of 10,000 views per video then you would charge a brand $500 for your services.</p><p>How much you should charge per view depends on your genre and the nature of your audience.

If you charge $0.05 per view and you get an average of 10,000 views per video then you would charge a brand $500 for your services.</p><p>How much you should charge per view depends on your genre and the nature of your audience. If you often mention products you like in videos and your subscribers have come to trust your recommendations, then it makes sense for you to charge more per view than a creator whose audience will be less receptive to product placement.</p><p>For example, if you do makeup tutorials then viewers will be used to hearing about your favorites. This makes your 10 000 views more valuable than 10 000 views on a ranting vlog channel whose subscribers are not tuning in to hear about products.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money With FameBit"></a>How to Make Money With FameBit</h2><h4 id="Finding-Sponsorships-3"><a href="#Finding-Sponsorships-3" class="headerlink" title="Finding Sponsorships"></a>Finding Sponsorships</h4><p>Brands post details about their upcoming campaigns, and the types of creators they are interested in working with, on FameBit.</p><p>While you are browsing through the available campaigns, think of the types of brands you would be excited to work with as well as which ones make sense for your channel.</p><p>If you host a lifestyle vlog about staying healthy, for example, and there is an opportunity to work with a brand that sells a type of healthy snack then it is your responsibility to look into the company and the product before you sign on to work with them. Is the snack healthy, and do you enjoy it?</p><p>Ideally, you will want to find brands that share your values and which are selling products you feel good about recommending to your subscribers.</p><p>Once you find a few campaigns you are interested in creating videos for, it’s time to write your proposals and negotiate with your potential sponsors.</p><h4 id="Negotiating-with-Sponsors-3"><a href="#Negotiating-with-Sponsors-3" class="headerlink" title="Negotiating with Sponsors"></a>Negotiating with Sponsors</h4><p>When you want to be part of a campaign a brand has posted, you send them a proposal.</p><p>Be creative and detailed in the proposals you write. The best brands will value you for our ideas and creativity, and this will give you an edge over creators who put less effort into their pitches. You also want to be detailed because you do not want to risk having a disagreement with the brand based on them misunderstanding what you were going to do.</p><p>Sometimes brands will have very specific things they want you to do or say in the video you make for them. It is your job to find ways of doing and saying these things that still feel natural within the context of your videos. On YouTube, even when you are representing a brand, you need to be authentically you.</p><p>If you feel like the things a brand wants from you will make your video come across as a tacky commercial and offend your loyal subscribers, and you cannot see a creative way around this, bring it up before you agree to work with them. Explain what you think should happen instead. If they are not willing to compromise, do not agree to work with them. Find a more reasonable brand to partner with.</p><p>If you offend your subscribers and they stop watching you then your channel will become less valuable to other potential sponsors. In the long run, there is no upside to agreeing to do a video that makes no sense for your channel.</p><p>Remember that even brands that like your ideas and get excited about your proposals will not be able to work with you if you do not meet their requirements in terms of subscribers and average views. There are a lot of campaigns on FameBit which are open to small or mid-sized channels, but there will always be minimum requirements. It makes no sense for a brand to pay you to make a video nobody will see, even if it is an amazing video. Sad, but true.</p><h4 id="How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience"></a>How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience</h4><p>Some of your subscribers will resent any branded content you create and there is no way around that. These subscribers will be in the minority – most people understand that accepting sponsorship from brands helps their favorite YouTubers continue making great videos – but it is unavoidable that there will be a few.</p><p>Most of your subscribers will not be bothered by the idea of you partnering with a brand, so long as you go about it in the right way.</p><p>Firstly; be honest about your sponsorship. Do not pretend to be giving an objective opinion on a product when the company who makes it is paying you. Your viewers will know and they will be offended.</p><p>Secondly; incorporate the brand’s message or product into your videos in ways that feel natural. Do not stray too far from your usual video style. Ultimately every video you make, even branded content, is for your viewers. Make the kind of video they expect from you and mention the product or service you have agreed to in a place where it makes sense&#x2F;is on topic.</p><p>You want the branding in your videos to be subtle, but you never want to hide that it is there.</p><p>So long as you are honest and the more commercial elements of your video are not distracting, the vast majority of your subscribers – the ones you have built a real relationship with – will not mind.</p><h2 id="Custom-Videos-with-Awesome-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Custom-Videos-with-Awesome-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Custom Videos with Awesome Video Editor"></a>Custom Videos with Awesome Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Scaling-Up-on-YouTube-A-Roadmap-for-Million-Sub-Club"><a href="#Scaling-Up-on-YouTube-A-Roadmap-for-Million-Sub-Club" class="headerlink" title="Scaling Up on YouTube: A Roadmap for Million-Sub Club"></a>Scaling Up on YouTube: A Roadmap for Million-Sub Club</h2><h1 id="Case-Study-How-to-Grow-on-YouTube-to-Have-Millions-of-Subs"><a href="#Case-Study-How-to-Grow-on-YouTube-to-Have-Millions-of-Subs" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: How to Grow on YouTube to Have Millions of Subs"></a>Case Study: How to Grow on YouTube to Have Millions of Subs</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>You’ve probably heard of stories about individuals who managed to find financial success on YouTube.

Because of its huge community, the videos of Youtube are shared on all platforms throughout the internet. If you are the one who often shares Youtube links with others then you must know how important it is to keep the links as short as possible. There are so many reasons for avoiding long links while sharing Youtube links with others. Whether it’s a blog, social media platform, or a chat, keeping the Youtube link while sharing it can positively impact the viewer. Several Youtube link shorteners can help you shorten the links and make them worthy of sharing. In this article, we will list down Top 5 Youtube link shorteners to help you choose the best. But before moving towards link shorteners, let’s discuss the benefit of using Youtube link shorteners.</p><hr><h2 id="Why-should-we-use-Youtube-Link-Shorteners"><a href="#Why-should-we-use-Youtube-Link-Shorteners" class="headerlink" title="Why should we use Youtube Link Shorteners?"></a>Why should we use Youtube Link Shorteners?</h2><p>One of the vital reasons to use Youtube Link Shortener is to increase the click-throughs and shares. Short links are more prone to getting clicks and shares because they look simple and professional as compare to long and stuffy links.

YouTube gamers are among some of the most popular vloggers on YouTube. To be a successful YouTube gamer you need have both gaming skills and a great vlogging presence.</p><p>Posting a cool gaming videos once in a while for your friends is fun, and if that is all you want to do then the first tip on this list should help you out. If you are hoping to build a popular YouTube channel centered on gaming then you will want to read further. Gaming vlogs are more than just hobbies for successful YouTube gamers. They put a lot of work into them.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about being a gaming vlogger is that gameplay footage is protected by copyright. Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games. There will usually be information on the manufacturer’s website, often in the ‘Terms of Use’ section, which explains their policy. If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p><hr><p>Looking for a good video editor for your gaming video? Wondershare Filmora is recommended. It is not just a video editor which allows you to cut, split, add text, apply background sound to your video clips, but also a screen recorder which helps you record videos from PC screem webcam, and voice over. What’s more, you can find lots of special effects for gaming in this software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p>&lt;2&gt; Four tips for YouTube gamers:</p><h4 id="1-Equipment"><a href="#1-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="1. Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"                      alt="gamer elgato"                ></p><p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p><p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p><p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p><p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p><h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p><p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p><h4 id="3-Time-Management"><a href="#3-Time-Management" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p><p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p><p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p><h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p><p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p><p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums.
