Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>. Check the box next to <strong>Always Show Captions</strong>, and then check   <strong>Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition</strong>. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The <strong>Always Show Captions</strong> feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.</p><p>If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   <strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> . If the language you want is not there select <strong>Auto-Translate</strong>  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.</p><h2 id="Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps"><a href="#Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps"></a>Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to <strong>Video Manager</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.</p><p>2. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose <strong>Subtitles and CC</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Add New</strong> <strong>Subtitles or CC</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.</p><p><strong>Create Subtitles or Closed Captions</strong> will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Upload A File</strong> allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and Set Timings</strong> is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.</p><p><strong>Use Automatic Captioning</strong> will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.</p><p><strong>Use Captioning Software or Services</strong> is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.</p><p>The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use <strong>Automatic Captioning</strong>. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-analyzing-the-frequency-of-youtube-payments/"><u>In 2024, Analyzing the Frequency of YouTube Payments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-starting-points-on-youtube-top-16-opener-list-for-growth/"><u>In 2024, Best Starting Points on YouTube  Top 16 Opener List for Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-borrow-without-cost-images-from-leading-youtubers-archives/"><u>[New] Borrow Without Cost Images From Leading YouTubers' Archives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/audio-anomalies-top-disruptive-apps-on-the-go/"><u>Audio Anomalies  Top Disruptive Apps on the Go</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-5-non-youtube-editing-tools-for-vids/"><u>In 2024, Best 5 Non-YouTube Editing Tools for Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/discover-10-amazing-world-wanderlust-channels/"><u>Discover 10 Amazing World Wanderlust Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-captivating-content-with-a-click-phones-and-youtube/"><u>[New] Captivating Content with a Click  Phones & YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-create-effective-youtube-advertisements-on-a-budget/"><u>2024 Approved  Create Effective YouTube Advertisements on a Budget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/sound-engineering-tips-to-elevate-your-video-content/"><u>Sound Engineering Tips to Elevate Your Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-decrypting-youtube-live-thumbnails-for-success/"><u>[Updated] Decrypting YouTube Live Thumbnails for Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/quick-tips-efficiently-capturing-moments-with-snap-features-in-meet-for-2024/"><u>Quick Tips  Efficiently Capturing Moments with Snap Features in Meet for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-where-is-the-best-place-to-catch-dratini-on-nokia-c110-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Nokia C110 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-rescue-lost-contacts-from-spark-20c-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to Rescue Lost Contacts from Spark 20C?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/elite-list-tiktoks-most-accurate-earning-analyzers/"><u>Elite List  TikTok's Most Accurate Earning Analyzers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-your-channelenas-expensive-check-out-our-11-free-name-generators-guide/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Your Channel'enas Expensive?

Let Viewers Know What is Coming"></a>1. Let Viewers Know What is Coming</h3><p> People appreciate routine. You can mention how many times a week you create content and the days when you publish. You can also have a brief overview of the type of videos you make, which will tell a new viewer what to expect if they subscribe to your channel!</p><h3 id="2-Keep-It-Short"><a href="#2-Keep-It-Short" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep It Short"></a>2. Keep It Short</h3><p> YouTube trailers that are more than a minute long will not succeed. People have a very short attention span. They want to be hooked immediately. 30 to 45 seconds is the sweet spot, with 30 seconds preferable! It may sound overwhelming to condense everything about your channel into 30 seconds, but that is where a great video script can help! However, sometimes <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/short-form-vs-long-form-video-the-answer-is-sometimes%5Fus%5F595d275ae4b0f078efd98de4" >both short videos and long videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Some-Fun-Annotations"><a href="#3-Use-Some-Fun-Annotations" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Some Fun Annotations"></a>3. Use Some Fun Annotations</h3><p> YouTube is great for having unique and helpful graphics on the screen while your video is playing. Having some fun and useful annotations, such as the days you make videos or a subscribe icon, during the intro video can be very helpful to new viewers. They also help to boost viewer engagement with your content!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/annotations-channel-trailer.JPG"                      alt="annotations channel trailer"                ></p><h3 id="4-Assume-You-Have-New-Viewers"><a href="#4-Assume-You-Have-New-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. Assume You Have New Viewers"></a>4. Assume You Have New Viewers</h3><p> Do not create a YouTube channel trailer with inside jokes or comments. This trailer is for people who know nothing about you or your channel. You are trying to hook them into your content, not provide a few laughs to existing subscribers.</p><h3 id="5-Update-Your-Trailer-Regularly"><a href="#5-Update-Your-Trailer-Regularly" class="headerlink" title="5. Update Your Trailer Regularly"></a>5. Update Your Trailer Regularly</h3><p> As a content creator, you may find that your brand changes every six months to a year. Maybe you change up your look, type of content, frequency of uploads or other parts of the channel.

></th><th>Best daily vlogging camera: Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX 100 V You don’t have to be a filmmaking pro if you want to use a compact camera to record all sorts of videos. Sony’s Cyber-shot series is famous for its cutting-edge features and the DSC-RX 100 V model is not an exception. This camera is equipped with a 20.1 MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor that supports ISO sensitivities up to ISO 12800. You can record footage in UHD 4K at 30 or 24 fps, although with a five-minute limit, as well as Full HD videos at a maximum of 960 fps when recording in the HFR mode. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX 100 V ships with a non-interchangeable Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T lens that performs well under low-light conditions and in broad daylight. The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording. DSC RX-100 V’s multi-functionality makes it one of the best cameras for daily vlogging, especially for vloggers who are planning on shooting vlogs in various locations.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Light and easy to carry around</em> <em>- Produces high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Short battery life</em> <em>- Lacking a touchscreen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best cheap vlogging camera: Canon EOS M100 Canon’s EOS M100 is small and powerful. This mirrorless camera produces full HD videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t, however, shoot 4K footage. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 7 image processor ensure that your vlogs are always in focus and rich in detail. The Canon EOS M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options, offering ISO values as high as 25600, making it a great option for vloggers that often shoot their videos under difficult light conditions. The 3-inch touchscreen LCD lets you control focus points, navigate through the camera’s menu, or watch videos you’ve created. The screen can also be tilted in the upward direction to provide you a better preview of the shot you’re recording. The camera has a built-in Wi-Fi with NFC so you can transfer your videos seamlessly to a computer and have fun in the process. The Canon EOS M100 is currently one of the best entry-level cameras for daily vlogging on the market because it produces videos in great picture quality that you don’t have to spend a fortune for.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Affordable</em> <em>- Great connectivity options</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Lacks advanced video recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 wins this category as well in our books because it’s a powerful, feature-rich camera that’s also very affordable.

Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200. This camera uses the Canon EF lens mount, so you can choose the lens that best suits your needs. The Canon EOS M50 can capture UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps, and it also lets you record 120 fps slow-motion videos at 720p.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Has an external microphone port</em> <em>- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No image stabilization</em> <em>- Battery life could be longer</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png"                      alt="Panasonic GH5S"                ></td><td>Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic’s GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world’s first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That’s why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera’s 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There’s very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800</em> <em>- High video bit rates</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Expensive</em> <em>- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price. The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 has a DIGIC 7 image processor and a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor that lets you extend the ISO value to 51200 and shoot your vlogs even under low light conditions. This camera can capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, and it features a 9-point AF system and dual pixel CMOS AF technologies that provide precise and quick focusing even when there is not much light. The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D’s 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/stay-steady-with-the-right-tripod-techniques-for-top-notch-video-content/"><u>Stay Steady with the Right Tripod Techniques for Top-Notch Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-play-button-visuals-vivid-neon-lines-added/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Play Button Visuals  Vivid Neon Lines Added</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-enhance-your-youtube-presence-with-these-top-10-editors/"><u>[New] Enhance Your YouTube Presence with These Top 10 Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/million-visioners-dissecting-the-money-behind-the-numbers/"><u>Million Visioners  Dissecting the Money Behind the Numbers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/boosting-your-channels-viewer-loyalty-essential-tactics-unveiled-for-2024/"><u>Boosting Your Channels' Viewer Loyalty  Essential Tactics Unveiled for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-practical-guide-to-applying-creative-commons-rights/"><u>2024 Approved  A Practical Guide To Applying Creative Commons Rights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/vloggers-guide-to-top-5-game-microphones/"><u>Vloggers’ Guide to Top 5 Game Microphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/awakening-with-animation-the-cutest-and-brightest-channels-for-2024/"><u>Awakening with Animation  The Cutest and Brightest Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-decoding-the-wealth-of-mr-beast/"><u>[New] Decoding the Wealth of Mr. Beast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-global-gala-of-greatest-video-views-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Global Gala of Greatest Video Views for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-apple-id-and-apple-password-from-iphone-12-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Reset Apple ID and Apple Password From iPhone 12 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-oneplus-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On OnePlus 11 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-fake-gps-location-spoofer-a-good-choice-on-realme-c33-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Is Fake GPS Location Spoofer a Good Choice On Realme C33 2023? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/understanding-srt-in-depth-with-this-guidebook-for-2024/"><u>Understanding SRT in Depth with This Guidebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-teaching-with-technology-incorporating-youtube-into-lessons/"><u>[New] Teaching with Technology  Incorporating YouTube Into Lessons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-harmonizing-visuals-with-auditory-elements-effective-strategies-for-music-integration-in-final-cut-pro/"><u>New Harmonizing Visuals with Auditory Elements Effective Strategies for Music Integration in Final Cut Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/gigglegif-genius/"><u>GiggleGif Genius</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-xiaomi-redmi-note-13-5g-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top Apps and Online Tools To Track Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G Phone With/Without IMEI Number</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-review-of-the-leading-no-cost-cam-software-options/"><u>In 2024, Expert Review of the Leading No-Cost Cam Software Options</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers. It would be much more beneficial to your channel to build good relationships with other YouTubers to possibly collaborate on a video together in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/avoid-commonplace-channel-titles-finding-uniqueness-with-filmora-for-2024/"><u>Avoid Commonplace Channel Titles  Finding Uniqueness with Filmora for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-borrow-without-cost-images-from-leading-youtubers-archives/"><u>[Updated] Borrow Without Cost Images From Leading YouTubers' Archives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/transform-yt-video-quality-utilizing-the-power-of-wm-maker/"><u>Transform YT Video Quality  Utilizing the Power of WM Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/digital-broadcast-face-off-facebook-vs-youtube-and-tweetstreams-for-2024/"><u>Digital Broadcast Face-Off  FACEbook Vs.

Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.</p><p>Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg"                      alt="youtube platform"                ></p><p>Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos</h2><p>YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube aspect ratio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar’s white or grey&#x2F;black area along the edges.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop&#x2F;PC Version:</p><p>If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:</p><p>There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version</p><p>Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg"                      alt="vertical video example"                ></p><p>Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio</h2><p>The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube shorts ratio"                ></p><p>Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.</p><p>Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads"><a href="#Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads"></a>Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads</h2><p>If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income. Or, if you are already in some business and want to grow your business, do it with YouTube Ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-ads-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube-ads-aspect-ratio"                ></p><p>Now, you might be wondering, what would be the possible YouTube Outro size or YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for YouTube Ads? Check here:</p><p>YouTube Video Aspect ratio and Proportions: 19:9 (640X360), 4:3 (480X360)</p><p>Aspect Ratio for Desktop Ads: 16:9</p><p>Sponsor Card Ads Ratio: 1:1</p><p>True View Discovery Ads Ratio: 16:9 or 4:3</p><h2 id="Part-4-Think-More-about-YouTube-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-4-Think-More-about-YouTube-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 4 Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio</h2><p>You have been listening about YouTube Screen size or YouTube Aspect Ratio so far many times. Now the biggest question is, how to adjust the Aspect Ratio of YouTube Video or Shorts?</p><p>Are you puzzled?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-set-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="how to set aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Yeah!

It’s not. Don’t do it.</p><p>Seeing your videos get just a handful of views even though they are nicely filmed and cover interesting topics can be frustrating. Some YouTubers aren’t patient enough to meticulously grow their channels, which is why they opt to buy views and subscribers from providers that promise miracles.</p><p>The question remains whether or not these aforementioned miracles are just a scam designed to take your money. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Buying subscribers carries a certain amount of risks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, because YouTube’s algorithm may recognize fake subscribers and views, and that can result in a red flag on your channel or a ban.

However, low prices for such services are the first sign that something isn’t right because getting hundreds of subscribers for just $5 is unrealistic.</p><p><a href="https://viralyft.com/buy-youtube-subscribers"><strong>Viralyft</strong>:</a> There are many ways to grow your YouTube channel, and buying subscribers is one of the most dangerous ways, since it may result in penalties that will ruin your YouTube channel. Viralyft is offering 500 worldwide subscribers for $49.99, and they provide no information about the delivery method. You should always ask questions about the delivery method before doing business with a service like this.</p><p>One thing they do promise is that the subscribers you can buy from them are safe, but they offer no proof that you will not be caught.</p><p><a href="http://www.view2.be/buy-youtube-subscribers/"><strong>View2be:</strong></a> View2Be offers 500 subscribers for $45. This is a more realistic price than $5, but the delivery time they are promising could be risky. A sudden increase in subscribers within 24 to 72 hours could raise a red flag with YouTube’s algorithm suspicion.</p><p>View2Be does guarantee to give you your money back if they don’t deliver subscribers.</p><p>A better alternative to buying subscribers from View2be might be their view exchange platform, in which you earn real human views on your videos by watching other people’s videos.</p><p><a href="https://zeru.com/buy-youtube-views"><strong>ZERU:</strong></a> A huge number of clients that are advertised as a sort of a guarantee that the ZERU provides reliable services. This is somewhat misleading because it diverts the attention from the truly important information. There is no sign of delivery method explanations (where do the subscribers come from?), only a promise that they will deliver the subscribers within a day or two.</p><p>You want to know where your subscribers are coming from. If you are an American YouTuber, for example, and you suddenly receive a large number of subscribers from Asian countries then that will be suspicious of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><p>YTView’s claim that subscribers you will be buying are 100% real isn’t supported by any other fact featured on their website. ZERU will sell you a hundred subscribers for $20.</p><p><a href="https://www.qqtube.com/"><strong>QQTube</strong>:</a> For only $25 you can get 10,000 subscribers per day, which is one of the cheapest offers on the market. That delivery window could look suspicious to YouTube, but if that’s a risk you’re willing to take then with QQTube at least you won’t be risking a lot of money.</p><p>QQTube’s website doesn’t mention anything about safety, which is worrying, but they do offer geographic targeting which is important.</p><p><a href="http://socialgrand.com/buy-youtube-subscribers/"><strong>SocialGrand:</strong></a> Social Grand offers 500 subscribers for $34,90 or a thousand subscribers for $62,90. They promise to get your YouTube channel a better reputation, which is a huge claim that we would be wary of.</p><p>Their argument that their service is cost-effective and that it will earn you money is not only a cause for concern, but it is dangerous as well because penalties for fake subscribers on AdSense are much harsher than on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Get-Free-Subscribers"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Get-Free-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Get Free Subscribers"></a>Top 3 Ways to Get Free Subscribers</h2><p>YouTube’s community and YouTube’s algorithm both favor authenticity, and for that reason, these organic ways to get subscribers will have a much stronger impact on your YouTube channel than any amount of subscribers you can buy.</p><p>Buying subscribers creates the illusion of short-term growth, while these free methods will result in real long-term growth.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Master SEO:</strong></a> If you would like to grow your YouTube channel, then mastering SEO is the right way to go. Use keywords in the titles of your videos, playlists, and your videos’ descriptions.</p><p>Many powerful keyword research tools can help you find the best keywords for your videos. One simple method is to simply search for your topic on Google and YouTube and see what other content creators are using to rank well.</p><p>A good performance in search rankings can only be achieved by strategic thinking and careful planning, so before you upload a video to YouTube do a little research to find the best keywords for your videos.</p><p>You can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube SEO here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Post Consistently: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> You can hardly expect to have a loyal community of subscribers if you post videos every two or three months. Post a lot of videos and post them consistently (i.e. on the same day every week) because, if you do so, viewers will feel the anticipation and be more likely to watch your videos as soon as they are uploaded. Getting a lot of traffic in the first 24 hours of your video being uploaded is great for SEO.</p><p>If you manage to post four videos in a month, the number of subscribers to your account will grow organically, and you won’t need fake subscribers. You’ll get new subscribers for free.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Produce Collab Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> Nobody can make it on their own; we all need the support of the people around us. Collaborating with other YouTubers that share your interest in the topic you are covering can be beneficial in many ways. First, when you collaborate you each introduce the other creator to a lot of new potential subscribers. Second, you begin to build a support network that you can rely on when you run into trouble (your YouTube friends may be able to share useful advice and even resources with you as you both grow).</p><p>Considering the risks, would YOU ever buy YouTube subscribers?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/curate-a-perfect-playlist-on-youtube-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2024/"><u>Curate a Perfect Playlist on YouTube  A Step-by-Step Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-earths-highest-paid-online-video-personality/"><u>2024 Approved  Earth's Highest-Paid Online Video Personality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-award-winning-musicians-on-youtube-you-must-see/"><u>[New] Award-Winning Musicians on YouTube You Must See</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-conveniently-connect-with-others-via-your-playlist/"><u>[New] Conveniently Connect with Others via Your Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/1716464202864-fascinating-fantasy-youtubes-best-magic-video-editing/"><u>Fascinating Fantasy  YouTube's Best Magic Video Editing!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/charting-your-course-in-youtubing-dodge-these-top-8-common-missteps-for-2024/"><u>Charting Your Course in YouTubing  Dodge These Top 8 Common Missteps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-elevate-youtube-content-advanced-editing-using-wm-maker/"><u>[New] Elevate YouTube Content  Advanced Editing Using WM Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-your-google-meet-into-a-youtube-live-event/"><u>How To Turn Your Google Meet Into a YouTube Live Event</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-online-converter-turn-facebook-vids-into-mp3/"><u>2024 Approved  Online Converter  Turn Facebook Vids Into MP3</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-photographicperfection-how-to-fine-tune-insta-images-and-videos/"><u>[Updated] PhotographicPerfection  How to Fine-Tune Insta Images & Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-unveiled-top-6-tools-to-purify-signature-images-online/"><u>[Updated] Unveiled  Top 6 Tools to Purify Signature Images Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-superior-sonic-collectors-for-seminars/"><u>2024 Approved  Superior Sonic Collectors for Seminars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-streamlining-screen-record-on-snapchats-with-your-phone/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamlining Screen Record on Snapchats with Your Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-dance-dynamics-the-viral-tiktok-step-by-step/"><u>[Updated] Dance Dynamics  The Viral TikTok Step-by-Step</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/adding-apple-music-a-guide-to-enhanced-videos/"><u>Adding Apple Music  A Guide to Enhanced Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-seamless-offline-experience-best-playlist-downloader-tools-reviewed/"><u>[New] Seamless Offline Experience  Best Playlist Downloader Tools Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/latest-guide-how-to-bypass-vivo-t2-5g-frp-without-computer-by-drfone-android/"><u>Latest Guide How To Bypass Vivo T2 5G FRP Without Computer</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

OpenShot Video Editor</h2><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Easy to use</li><li>Includes transitions</li><li>Keyframing</li><li>Alpha Channel</li><li>Unlimited video tracks</li></ol><h4 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="OpenShot-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#OpenShot-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="OpenShot Video Editor Review"></a><strong>OpenShot Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>OpenShot completely lives up to the claim that it was designed to be ‘easy to use, quick to learn, and surprisingly powerful’.</p><p>The first time you use OpenShot there will be helpful tutorial notes to guide you through the program. The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p><p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p><p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p><h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p><p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p><p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p><h2 id="2-Shotcut"><a href="#2-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="**2. Shotcut"></a>**2. Shotcut</h2><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed audio editing</li><li>Color grading, ability to save presets</li><li>Fairly intuitive timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Shotcut-Review"><a href="#Shotcut-Review" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p><p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p><p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p><h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p><p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p><h2 id="3-Hitfilm-Express"><a href="#3-Hitfilm-Express" class="headerlink" title="**3. Hitfilm Express"></a>**3. Hitfilm Express</h2><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Compositing mode (2D and 3D)</li><li>The Most effect customization</li><li>Helpful User Guide &amp; tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Can be overwhelming</li><li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li></ol><h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p><p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p><p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p><p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p><h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p><h2 id="4-VideoPad-Video-Editor"><a href="#4-VideoPad-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="**4. VideoPad Video Editor"></a>**4. VideoPad Video Editor</h2><h4 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Easy to jump into</li><li>Moving text</li><li>Huge audio waveforms</li><li>Audio and visual effects</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>No longer updated</li></ol><h4 id="VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="VideoPad Video Editor Review"></a><strong>VideoPad Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>VideoPad Video Editor is an extremely easy to use program. It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p><p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p><p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p><h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p><p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p><h2 id="5-Lightworks"><a href="#5-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="**5. Lightworks"></a>**5. Lightworks</h2><h4 id="Pros-4"><a href="#Pros-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed color and audio editing</li><li>Multicam editing</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Exports limited to 720p for the free version</li><li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li></ol><h4 id="Lightworks-Review"><a href="#Lightworks-Review" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p><p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p><p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p><h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p><p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p><p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p><p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p><h2 id="6-VSDC-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-VSDC-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="**6. VSDC Video Editor"></a>**6. VSDC Video Editor</h2><h4 id="Pros-5"><a href="#Pros-5" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Diagrams and charts</strong></li><li>How To Get Started Guide</li><li>Lots of features</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Very confusing</li><li>Paid features show up in the free version, but they’re blocked</li></ol><h4 id="Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor"><a href="#Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Review of VSDC Video Editor"></a><strong>Review of VSDC Video Editor</strong></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about VSDC Video Editor, but you have to do a lot of work to uncover any of it. Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite" class="headerlink" title="**7. Machete Video Editor Lite"></a>**7. Machete Video Editor Lite</h2><h4 id="Pros-6"><a href="#Pros-6" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Great for harvesting clips from longer footage</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Cannot swap or add audio</li><li>Only supports two formats (AVI and WMV)</li><li>Slightly awkward timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux"><a href="#8-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="**8. Avidemux"></a>**8. Avidemux</h2><h4 id="Pros-7"><a href="#Pros-7" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Can add subtitle files</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-5"><a href="#Cons-5" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Not intuitive</li><li>Doesn’t support MOV or WMV</li><li>The website is not informative, no tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Avidemux-Review"><a href="#Avidemux-Review" class="headerlink" title="Avidemux Review"></a><strong>Avidemux Review</strong></h4><p>Avidemux is not an easy program to jump into. I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/diverse-vlogging-content-suggestions/"><u>Diverse Vlogging Content Suggestions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/digital-dome-streamlining-your-song-posts-on-youtube/"><u>Digital Dome  Streamlining Your Song Posts on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-inserting-songs-into-youtube-clips/"><u>The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Inserting Songs Into YouTube Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-essential-tips-and-tricks-for-creating-killer-short-videos-on-yt/"><u>[New] Essential Tips and Tricks for Creating Killer Short Videos on YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/opposite-ends-of-the-coin-creative-youtube-rewind-strategies/"><u>Opposite Ends of the Coin  Creative Youtube Rewind Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/viewership-victory-surpassing-500-subscriber-mark/"><u>Viewership Victory  Surpassing 500 Subscriber Mark</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-and-uploading-lengthy-video-masterpieces-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting & Uploading Lengthy Video Masterpieces on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/proven-audacity-strategies-for-top-quality-recordings-for-2024/"><u>Proven Audacity Strategies for Top-Quality Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-10-stellar-tools-that-amplify-your-videos-youtube-presence-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 10 Stellar Tools That Amplify Your Video's YouTube Presence for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/key-applications-for-superior-vtuber-audible-identity/"><u>Key Applications for Superior Vtuber Audible Identity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-solutions-to-spy-on-realme-c53-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Solutions to Spy on Realme C53 with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-10-best-free-video-rotation-software-for-flipping-clips-for-2024/"><u>New 10 Best Free Video Rotation Software for Flipping Clips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-amplify-your-contents-impact-a-tiktok-hashtag-guide/"><u>[Updated] How to Amplify Your Content's Impact  A TikTok Hashtag Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-top-8-online-places-for-free-3d-text-files/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide  Top 8 Online Places for Free 3D Text Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-id-locked-for-security-reasons-on-iphone-13-find-the-best-solution-here-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Apple ID Locked for Security Reasons On iPhone 13?

Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> For creating a perfect thumbnail, select “Drone Free Camera” mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Open Filmora X, make sure to select the 16:9 screen ratio. Import the screenshot using the import button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Drag and drop the screenshot into the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Now, let’s separate the background and character. Go to the Effects, then AI Portrait, select Human Segmentation, and drop it into the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Filmora will ask you to purchase it, but you can now hit “Try it” to use it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 08:</strong> It will remove the background of the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 09:</strong> To add a background, go to the media and navigate to “Sample Color.” Drag a color of your choice and drop it below the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> To add titles in the Thumbnail, go to the Titles tab. Here you can find several categories of titles. Find your preferred title and drop it above all the layers. You can choose titles, lower thirds, and other texts depending upon your need and requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> We can make this Fortnite Thumbnail look more attractive by adding elements such as stickers and icons. Filmora contains a wide range of stickers. To access them, navigate to the Elements tab. Here you can find so many categories of elements. Choose any elements according to your need and drop them in the timeline above all other layers. If you cannot find a suitable sticker, you can download one from the internet and use it by importing it into Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Once you are satisfied with the final results, you can take the screenshot of the Thumbnail using the Snapshot icon located below the preview panel. It will create a screenshot in the media panel of Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> To access the directory where this screenshot is saved, right-click on the screenshot and click on “Reveal in Explorer.” It will open the folder that contains all the screenshots you take through Filmora. Your Fortnite Thumbnail is ready to be used on your Youtube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13"                ></p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>With Filmora, there are no limits.

Having entertaining and&#x2F;or informative content is the most important thing, but making great videos can only get you so far if people never get a chance to watch them. There are strategies you can use to make sure people get a chance to watch your videos in the first place.</p><p>In this article, we will let you know how to get more views on <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Getting-More-Views-on-YouTube"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Getting-More-Views-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Getting More Views on YouTube"></a>10 Tips for Getting More Views on YouTube</h2><h3 id="1-Be-Searchable"><a href="#1-Be-Searchable" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Searchable"></a>1. Be Searchable</h3><p>A big part of how to get views on YouTube is making sure people get a chance to watch your videos. People cannot click on something that does not come up in their search results. If you want people to get the chance to see your vlog you need to tailor the titles, descriptions, and tags of your videos so that they come up in searches.</p><p>A good way to start is to do a search for your topic and check out how videos that come up first are tagged. This will give you a sense for what keywords you should try to incorporate. For a more in-depth explanation of how you can use your titles, descriptions, and tags to get more views read ‘How To Upload Videos to YouTube’ and watch Tasha’s video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views01.jpg"                      alt="be searchable"                ></p><h3 id="2-Link-Yourself"><a href="#2-Link-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Link Yourself"></a>2. Link Yourself</h3><p>If somebody is watching your video and enjoying it then they will probably welcome the chance to check out similar content. At the end of your videos always include a link to one of your previous videos. If somebody has watched your video all the way through then they must have liked it, and there is a good chance they will click your link. You can use either YouTube Cards or annotations to redirect viewers to your other videos.</p><p>You do not have to limit yourself to providing links only at the ends of your videos, but you should never include more than three total links in one video. If there are too many then people will start ignoring them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views02.jpg"                      alt="link yourself"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-Playlists"><a href="#3-Make-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Playlists"></a>3. Make Playlists</h3><p>Playlists work for the same reason that linking to your other videos does. If somebody likes what they are watching they will probably like watching something similar. The great thing about playlists is that the viewer does not have to take action and click on another of your videos – one just automatically plays when their current video ends. People watching a video on a playlist are more likely to watch multiple videos from that playlist.</p><p>If one of your videos is ranked high on a YouTube search, and that video is also on a playlist, then your playlist will also come up in that same search. This will put your other videos in the path of potential viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/playlist-youtube.JPG"                      alt="playlist"                ></p><h3 id="4-Ask-and-You-Shall-Receive"><a href="#4-Ask-and-You-Shall-Receive" class="headerlink" title="4. Ask and You Shall Receive"></a>4. Ask and You Shall Receive</h3><p>If you can get more people to subscribe to your videos then you will see your view counts start to snowball. How do you get people to subscribe and share your videos? Ask them to.</p><p>People are more likely to subscribe or share if they are prompted to, so make sure to remind viewers to subscribe and share in every video. Consider putting a ‘subscribe’ button at the end of every video.</p><h3 id="5-Use-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#5-Use-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="5. Use YouTube Cards"></a>5. Use YouTube Cards</h3><p>The overlays that show up in the videos are the YouTube cards. In the overlays, you may add any link, call-to-action-button, image or a title that can explain the content of your video or help in sales.</p><p>For instance, when you create a video series, YouTube card helps your viewers to get to the webpage directly when you mention the link on the card or find and watch the following video in the sequence easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-youtube-annotations-and-cards.jpg"                      alt="youtube cards"                ></p><h3 id="6-End-Screens-Is-Useful"><a href="#6-End-Screens-Is-Useful" class="headerlink" title="6. End Screens Is Useful"></a>6. End Screens Is Useful</h3><p>The YouTube end screens are one of the best ways to get YouTube views. It offers several options to your viewers through the Call-to-Action button when you create your brand. You may consider inviting your audiences to subscribe and suggest a few videos that they may like from your channel.</p><p>The end screens appear at the last 20 seconds of your video and up to 4 elements can be added to each of it. You may also add your landing page’s link in the ens screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-end-screen.JPG"                      alt="end screen"                ></p><h3 id="7-Optimize-Thumbnail"><a href="#7-Optimize-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="7. Optimize Thumbnail"></a>7. Optimize Thumbnail</h3><p>In order to get more views on YouTube, the thumbnail image optimization can play a big role.</p><p>For instance, a celebrity or superhero image can prove to be beneficial when displayed in the suggested videos section, organic search results page or while you share on the social media.</p><p>It is highly recommended that only high-quality images must be used. The image must feature clear, comprehensible, and attractive fonts with facial-closeups.</p><p>But, you may use it only if they’re included in your video. The image thumbnail must relate to the description and title you used for the video to boost its value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="thumbnail"                ></p><h3 id="8-Provide-Value"><a href="#8-Provide-Value" class="headerlink" title="8. Provide Value"></a>8. Provide Value</h3><p>To get more views on YouTube, the content you offer must be valuable. It must either help people to learn something like how-to videos or keep people entertained and engaged. When you offer valuable content, people get back to you for more and also help in increasing views in your future videos.</p><h3 id="9-Interact-With-Your-Viewers"><a href="#9-Interact-With-Your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="9. Interact With Your Viewers"></a>9. Interact With Your Viewers</h3><p>Without the viewers, it is not possible to get YouTube views so keeping your viewers in the loop is an ideal way to get more views on YouTube.</p><p>For instance, when a viewer leaves a comment on your video, it may be a positive or a negative one, try to respond in a much detailed manner without ignoring the comment. When you be a part of your viewer’s community and engage in their discussion, it shows you care for them and think about their success.</p><p>You may try to know if your content is helping them out and in return, they might remember your generosity and view more of your content in future. Do not be too pushy, just share your views or products and content.</p><h3 id="10-Use-Youtube-Analytics-Properly"><a href="#10-Use-Youtube-Analytics-Properly" class="headerlink" title="10. Use Youtube Analytics Properly"></a>10. Use Youtube Analytics Properly</h3><p>To achieve success, it is essential to experiment, track the results, and make necessary changes as per requirement.</p><p>The YouTube Analytics helps to check the videos that performed best, the engagement of the viewers, and your audience’s demographics as well. With a detailed report, you can make necessary changes to your strategy that can help you to get more views on youtube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.JPG"                      alt="youtube analytics"                ></p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Video Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Loop a YouTube Video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using the strategies explained above you do not need to leave the success of your videos up to chance. It is often completely random which YouTube videos go viral, but you can have a lot of influence over how many views you get. Support your own content through links, playlists, and in video promotion. Also, make sure your titles, descriptions, and tags are optimized for YouTube searches. These are great methods for getting more views on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-videos-youtube-tools-and-more/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Videos  YouTube Tools and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/easy-and-fast-convert-youtube-music-into-mp3-mac-version/"><u>Easy & Fast  Convert YouTube Music Into MP3, Mac Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-captivating-youtube-thumbnails-on-smartphones/"><u>In 2024, Crafting Captivating YouTube Thumbnails on Smartphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/pioneering-platforms-for-no-cost-media-downloads/"><u>Pioneering Platforms for No-Cost Media Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-cultivating-productive-collaboration-a-pathway-to-effective-collab-videos/"><u>[New] Cultivating Productive Collaboration  A Pathway to Effective Collab Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-dynamic-duo-shots-perfecting-youtube-video-splitting/"><u>[New] Dynamic Duo Shots  Perfecting YouTube Video Splitting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-captivate-and-enchant-explore-the-best-creative-reactions-on-yt/"><u>In 2024, Captivate and Enchant  Explore the Best Creative Reactions on YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-are-youtube-engagement-strategies-justifiable/"><u>[New] Are YouTube Engagement Strategies Justifiable?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-tying-emotions-to-the-right-soundtrack-in-movies/"><u>In 2024, Tying Emotions to the Right Soundtrack in Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-additional-instagram-filters-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[Updated] Unlock Additional Instagram Filters  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-lock-screen-wallpaper-on-motorola-moto-g04-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Lock Screen Wallpaper on Motorola Moto G04</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/enhance-performance-install-new-gpu-drivers/"><u>Enhance Performance: Install New GPU Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-realme-11-pro-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Realme 11 Pro to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-youtubes-vs-dailymentions-spotting-key-differences/"><u>[Updated] YouTubes Vs.

The most important element is obviously you, the creator. Your personality, ideas, and unique viewpoint are what will make your content special and turn viewers into subscribers.</p><p>The next most important thing – even more important than the camera you use – is editing.</p><p>Editing a YouTube video doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, it should be simple. Your focus when you’re perfecting your video should be on that ‘most important thing’ we mentioned earlier – your creativity.

It is an advanced tool that is focused more on newbie editors who are new to the videography world but want to compete with professionals!</p><h2 id="1-OpenShot-Video-Editor"><a href="#1-OpenShot-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="**1. OpenShot Video Editor"></a>**1. OpenShot Video Editor</h2><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Easy to use</li><li>Includes transitions</li><li>Keyframing</li><li>Alpha Channel</li><li>Unlimited video tracks</li></ol><h4 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="OpenShot-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#OpenShot-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="OpenShot Video Editor Review"></a><strong>OpenShot Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>OpenShot completely lives up to the claim that it was designed to be ‘easy to use, quick to learn, and surprisingly powerful’.</p><p>The first time you use OpenShot there will be helpful tutorial notes to guide you through the program. The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p><p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p><p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p><h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p><p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p><p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p><h2 id="2-Shotcut"><a href="#2-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="**2. Shotcut"></a>**2. Shotcut</h2><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed audio editing</li><li>Color grading, ability to save presets</li><li>Fairly intuitive timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Shotcut-Review"><a href="#Shotcut-Review" class="headerlink" title="Shotcut Review"></a><strong>Shotcut Review</strong></h4><p>Shotcut delivers a smooth, detailed, editing experience for free. It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p><p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p><p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p><h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p><p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p><h2 id="3-Hitfilm-Express"><a href="#3-Hitfilm-Express" class="headerlink" title="**3. Hitfilm Express"></a>**3. Hitfilm Express</h2><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Compositing mode (2D and 3D)</li><li>The Most effect customization</li><li>Helpful User Guide &amp; tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Can be overwhelming</li><li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li></ol><h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p><p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p><p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p><p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p><h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p><h2 id="4-VideoPad-Video-Editor"><a href="#4-VideoPad-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="**4. VideoPad Video Editor"></a>**4. VideoPad Video Editor</h2><h4 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Easy to jump into</li><li>Moving text</li><li>Huge audio waveforms</li><li>Audio and visual effects</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>No longer updated</li></ol><h4 id="VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="VideoPad Video Editor Review"></a><strong>VideoPad Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>VideoPad Video Editor is an extremely easy to use program. It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p><p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p><p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p><h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p><p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p><h2 id="5-Lightworks"><a href="#5-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="**5. Lightworks"></a>**5. Lightworks</h2><h4 id="Pros-4"><a href="#Pros-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Detailed color and audio editing</li><li>Multicam editing</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Exports limited to 720p for the free version</li><li>Difficult to learn compared to other free software</li></ol><h4 id="Lightworks-Review"><a href="#Lightworks-Review" class="headerlink" title="Lightworks Review"></a><strong>Lightworks Review</strong></h4><p>On their website, Lightworks claims to have an ‘intuitive interface’ and ‘easy timeline editing’. This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p><p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p><p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p><h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p><p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p><p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p><p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p><h2 id="6-VSDC-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-VSDC-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="**6. VSDC Video Editor"></a>**6. VSDC Video Editor</h2><h4 id="Pros-5"><a href="#Pros-5" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Diagrams and charts</strong></li><li>How To Get Started Guide</li><li>Lots of features</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Very confusing</li><li>Paid features show up in the free version, but they’re blocked</li></ol><h4 id="Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor"><a href="#Review-of-VSDC-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Review of VSDC Video Editor"></a><strong>Review of VSDC Video Editor</strong></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about VSDC Video Editor, but you have to do a lot of work to uncover any of it. Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite" class="headerlink" title="**7. Machete Video Editor Lite"></a>**7. Machete Video Editor Lite</h2><h4 id="Pros-6"><a href="#Pros-6" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Great for harvesting clips from longer footage</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Cannot swap or add audio</li><li>Only supports two formats (AVI and WMV)</li><li>Slightly awkward timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux"><a href="#8-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="**8. Avidemux"></a>**8. Avidemux</h2><h4 id="Pros-7"><a href="#Pros-7" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Can add subtitle files</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-5"><a href="#Cons-5" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Not intuitive</li><li>Doesn’t support MOV or WMV</li><li>The website is not informative, no tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Avidemux-Review"><a href="#Avidemux-Review" class="headerlink" title="Avidemux Review"></a><strong>Avidemux Review</strong></h4><p>Avidemux is not an easy program to jump into. I almost wrote that it couldn’t do anything besides make cuts to a clip before I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to find the contrast and brightness tools. If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/discovering-potential-youtubes-role-in-modern-education-strategies/"><u>Discovering Potential  YouTube's Role in Modern Education Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-crafting-a-profitable-youtube-content-strategy/"><u>[New] Crafting a Profitable YouTube Content Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/amplify-your-videos-enhancing-thumbnails-with-captivating-creative-bgs-for-2024/"><u>Amplify Your Videos  Enhancing Thumbnails with Captivating, Creative BGs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-techniques-crafting-youtube-shorts-images-on-the-fly/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Techniques  Crafting YouTube Shorts Images on the Fly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-8-unique-workout-concepts-for-a-pulse-raising-video-channel/"><u>[Updated] 8 Unique Workout Concepts for a Pulse-Raising Video Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/creating-unique-storytelling-in-your-haul-videos-for-2024/"><u>Creating Unique Storytelling in Your Haul Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/strategies-for-youtube-music-fusions/"><u>Strategies for YouTube Music Fusions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-video-impact-interpreting-youtube-metrics-wisely/"><u>[New] Enhancing Video Impact  Interpreting YouTube Metrics Wisely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-asmr-sound-mastery-selecting-the-ideal-microphone/"><u>[Updated] ASMR Sound Mastery  Selecting the Ideal Microphone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-add-audio-to-video-in-magix-movie-edit-pro/"><u>2024 Approved How to Add Audio to Video in Magix Movie Edit Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/realme-11-proplus-not-connecting-to-wi-fi-12-quick-ways-to-fix-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Realme 11 Pro+ Not Connecting to Wi-Fi? 12 Quick Ways to Fix | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-realme-narzo-n53-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Realme Narzo N53 Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/enthrall-emilia-romagna-dive-into-italian-colloquialisms/"><u>Enthrall Emilia Romagna: Dive Into Italian Colloquialisms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-take-your-editing-to-the-next-level-5-final-cut-pro-hacks/"><u>New In 2024, Take Your Editing to the Next Level 5 Final Cut Pro Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-free-yourself-from-subscription-fees-10-linux-video-editing-options-for-2024/"><u>New Free Yourself From Subscription Fees 10 Linux Video Editing Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/stuck-at-android-system-recovery-of-realme-11-proplus-fix-it-easily-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Stuck at Android System Recovery Of Realme 11 Pro+ ?

All you need to do to access it is, sign in to your Google account, tap the <strong>+</strong> button at the bottom, and tap <strong>Create a Short</strong> in the popup box that comes up.</p><ol><li><strong>What if YouTube Shorts is not showing on my YouTube app?</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that your YouTube app is updated to its latest version. If the app is already updated, and <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still unavailable, the chances are that Google hasn’t rolled the app in your region. Since <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still in its Beta phase, only the region of India can use all the functions of the app at the time of this writing. In such a case, you are suggested to wait until the <strong>YouTube Shorts app</strong> is made available for your location.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts video duration?</strong></li></ol><p>A <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> video can be of only up to 60 seconds.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts size limitation?</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube hasn’t provided any information related to this as of now. However, you can rest assure that a 60 seconds long video file wouldn’t be too large for YouTube to handle.</p><ol><li><strong>How many subs do you need to access Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is available for everyone regardless of the number of subscribers the channel has.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you make money on Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p>Unfortunately, NO. Although you cannot monetize the recordings published as <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong>, they can be a good source to drive subscribers to your main YouTube channel that may have the videos that can be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-best-live-stream-screen-recorders-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Best Live Stream Screen Recorders for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-easy-transition-from-local-to-global-stream-spotify-playlists-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Easy Transition From Local to Global  Stream Spotify Playlists on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/tips-for-youtube-thumbnail-size-aspect-ratio-included/"><u>Tips for YouTube Thumbnail Size [Aspect Ratio Included]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-boosting-views-essential-hashtags-for-trending-shorts/"><u>2024 Approved  Boosting Views  Essential Hashtags for Trending Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-audio-anomalies-essential-rhythm-altering-tools/"><u>[New] Audio Anomalies  Essential Rhythm Altering Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/curated-list-of-top-10-youtube-video-cutting-apps-for-2024/"><u>Curated List of Top 10 YouTube Video Cutting Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/viewer-count-trophies-and-channel-prominence-honors/"><u>Viewer Count Trophies & Channel Prominence Honors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-composing-correspondents-curtains/"><u>[Updated] Composing Correspondents' Curtains</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/is-the-smoothing-effect-in-photoshop-a-game-changer-or-not/"><u>Is the Smoothing Effect in Photoshop a Game Changer or Not?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-add-auto-captions-to-instagram-stories-and-reels-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Add Auto Captions to Instagram Stories and Reels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-creative-tiktok-pfp-ideas-to-make-your-tiktok-profile-stand-out/"><u>[New] In 2024, Creative TikTok PFP Ideas to Make Your TikTok Profile Stand Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-disseminate-your-tiktok-on-twitter-effectively/"><u>[New] Disseminate Your TikTok on Twitter Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-file-migration-pc-to-iphone-setup/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating File Migration  PC-to-iPhone Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-toontime-insightful-review-and-tutorials-2024/"><u>[New] ToonTime Insightful Review & Tutorials 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-engaging-viewers-and-vendors-a-guide-to-yt-sponsorships/"><u>[New] Engaging Viewers and Vendors  A Guide to YT Sponsorships</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/snapperview-4-review-synopsis/"><u>SnapperView 4 Review Synopsis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/banishing-bogus-buddies-from-instagram-social-structure-for-2024/"><u>Banishing Bogus Buddies From Instagram Social Structure for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.</p><p>A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link"></a>How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link</h2><p>YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following to the end of your channel URL:</p><p>?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.</p><p>This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>That’s a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor’s YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub%5C_confirmation=1" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking. The process for creating a YouTube subscribe link is easy and accessible to everyone.</p><h3 id="Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features lots of video and audio editing tools that enables you to cut, trim and touch up the video clip easily.

It is evident that a video must have a perfect soundtrack for video masterpieces, but ensuring it is copyright free music is a must.</p><p>It is because you would never want YouTube to remove your video due to copyright violation after working so hard on it. Fortunately, there are a few trusted resources that offer perfect royalty free music for youtube videos.</p><p>Here is a list of 10 best royalty free music for videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?"></a>Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?</h2><p>‘Royalty free’ does not mean that the artist has given up ownership of their music, just that they have licensed it for others to use. Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a ‘music by’ note in your video’s description.</p><p>Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube’s flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</h2><h3 id="1-YouTube-Audio-Library"><a href="#1-YouTube-Audio-Library" class="headerlink" title="1.

Are you looking for ways to make your video attractive and interesting? Well, one way to do so is to create a well-structured script. Whether it is a 30-second video or a full-length movie, a script will guide the video creation process. Below are some tips to keep in mind if you want to learn how to write a script for your YouTube video.</p><ol><li><a href="#before">Before Write Your YouTube Script</a></li><li><a href="#writing">Writing a Script for a YouTube Video</a></li><li><a href="#after">After Writing Your YouTube Video Script</a></li><li><a href="#bonus">Bonus Tip- Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ol><h2 id="Before-You-Write-Your-YouTube-Script"><a href="#Before-You-Write-Your-YouTube-Script" class="headerlink" title="Before You Write Your YouTube Script"></a>Before You Write Your YouTube Script</h2><p>Here are some things to do before you start writing your script for YouTube:</p><h3 id="1-Collect-Ideas"><a href="#1-Collect-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="1. Collect Ideas"></a>1. Collect Ideas</h3><p>Before you write the script, it’s a good idea to gather ideas. If you think of something, or if something funny happens, write it down right away. Keep a pen and notebook handy that way you will not forget about it.</p><h3 id="2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting"><a href="#2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting" class="headerlink" title="2. Find an area that is not distracting"></a>2. Find an area that is not distracting</h3><p>Once you have gathered enough ideas for the YouTube video, the next step is to find a place where you can write in peace and be inspired. Avoid any distractions to ensure that you will be able to put all your thoughts and ideas onto paper.</p><h2 id="Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Writing a Script for a YouTube Video"></a>Writing a Script for a YouTube Video</h2><p>Now that you’re ready to sit down and write, here’s what you do:</p><h3 id="1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story"><a href="#1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story" class="headerlink" title="1. Create an outline for your story"></a>1. Create an outline for your story</h3><p>The first step in writing a script is to develop an outline for the story. You might think that it is an unnecessary step, but it’s one of the most important steps to writing a script. The outline serves as a guide that will make the finished product better compared to when you just tried to wing it. One tip on how to write a script for a YouTube video is to have an outline for the beginning, middle, and ending of the video. Once you have all the elements of the story, then you can start with the first draft of the script.</p><h3 id="2-Set-the-tone"><a href="#2-Set-the-tone" class="headerlink" title="2. Set the tone"></a>2. Set the tone</h3><p>The tone you pick for the video will depend on your audience. It’s safe to assume that viewers want something that’s unique, informative, and engaging. In some cases, they look for a video that’s personal, and they can relate to it. Humor is also something that you should consider when writing a script.</p><h3 id="3-Just-keep-writing"><a href="#3-Just-keep-writing" class="headerlink" title="3. Just keep writing"></a>3. Just keep writing</h3><p>When you start writing it is important that you keep on doing it no matter what happens. Just write down everything that comes into your mind. After that, read what you’ve written. If you think that something needs to be replaced, then replace it. If you get more inspiration and think that the script is lacking, then add to it.</p><h3 id="4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured"><a href="#4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured" class="headerlink" title="4. Make sure that the script is well structured"></a>4. Make sure that the script is well structured</h3><p>It’s important to learn how to write a script that is well structured. Divide the script into four parts: Opening, Primer, Body, and Closing.</p><p>For the Opening part, ask a simple question that can be answered in the Body. Use the Primer section to inform viewers what they should expect from the video. The Body will contain the main content of the video. It should cover all the things that viewers need to know. Lastly, the closing wraps up the video by providing social media details and a teaser for the next video.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep It Concise</strong></li></ul><p>In a personal vlog-style video you might ramble and go off on amusing tangents, and that’s something viewers love within that genre. If you are trying to teach, however, your viewers will benefit more if you keep things concise and direct.</p><p>Tell people up front what point you are trying to make before you jump into making it.</p><ul><li><strong>Be Interactive</strong></li></ul><p>Talk to people, not at them.</p><p>While you are scripting and focusing on the information you want to deliver, it’s easy to forget to be personal.</p><p>Remember to refer to your audience as ‘you’, not ‘you guys’ (you are speaking to individual viewers, not a collective) and to include moments of engagement throughout your videos. Ask your viewers questions to keep their minds active, this also encourages them to leave comments.</p><h2 id="After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script"><a href="#After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script" class="headerlink" title="After Writing your YouTube Video Script"></a>After Writing your YouTube Video Script</h2><p>After writing the script, the next step is to invite a trusted friend or family member to look at the script. Ask them for their feedback and if they have any ideas to add. And don’t forget, be open-minded to feedback</p><p>These are the tips to keep in mind when considering how to write a script for a YouTube video.</p><h2 id="Add-Subtitles-to-Your-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Add-Subtitles-to-Your-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Creating subtitles with Wondershare Filmora is very easy and a newbie can easily add relevant texts to the video they are trying to edit with Filmora. You just simply need to launch Wondershare Filmora and import the video that you want to edit. Now, go to the Titles tab and select the template that you want to pick and drag it on the timeline and click Apply.
