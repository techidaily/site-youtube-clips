That’s all you want to know.</p><p>In this article, we are going to address the key areas that YouTubers need to understand when it comes to YouTube copyright. What is okay and what isn’t? What may be considered risky or what would be worth taking a chance?</p><p>Remember that everything discussed in this article is only best practices and shouldn’t be taken as definitive legal advice.</p><p>Now that we are set, let’s dive in:</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Fair Use?"></a>Part 1: What is Fair Use?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube copyright, we have to talk about fair use.</p><p>Without fair use, there wouldn’t be any flexibility for creators. There wouldn’t be mashups, parodies, or lip dubs. Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p><p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p><ol><li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li><li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li><li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p><p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p><p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p><p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p><p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p><p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike"></a>Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike</h2><p>If you are reading this, you may have already gotten a YouTube copyright strike.</p><p>This may have surprised you. Don’t be too concerned. If it was a mistake, the copyright strike merely acts as a warning, letting you know that the content in your video is copyrighted material.</p><p>However, if you were to get 3 copyright strikes in 90 days, you may be penalized by:</p><p>- Having all your accounts and videos removed</p><p>- Not being able to create a new channel</p><p>So what should you do? Here are the steps to take after you receive a copyright strike:</p><ol><li>Review the copyright strike by going into Creator Studio &gt; Video Manager &gt; Copyright notice</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-copyright-notice.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Copyright notice"                ></p><ol><li>Click on the “Copyright Strike” link beside the flagged video to see details</li><li>Decide how to respond to the strike:  <ol><li>Allow the strike to expire after 90 days and complete the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >YouTube’s copyright school <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  </li><li>Contact the person who reported your video and get the claim retracted  </li><li>Dispute the claim with a counter notification</li></ol></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dispute-youtube-copyright-claim.jpg"                      alt="Dispute YouTube Copyright Claims"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike"></a>Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike</h2><p>It’s not always clear what YouTube deems fair use, but there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of meeting the qualification.</p><p><strong>1. Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p><p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p><p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p><p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p><p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p><p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p><p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p><p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130533/26400" target="_top" id="2130533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130533/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content"></a>Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content</h2><p>As a new YouTuber, it’s a little freaky to think that someone is taking your content and republishing it or using your creations in their video without your permission.</p><p>If you ever notice that your content is being copied without your approval — if they have duplicated your video completely or is using your video without giving credit — and it is not benefiting your channel in any way, don’t worry, YouTube is designed to protect you.</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube"><a href="#Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube"></a><strong>Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube</strong></h4><ol><li>View the video that contains your copyrighted material.</li><li>Click on “Report”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-copyright-infringement-youtube.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Select “Infringes my rights” in the pop up window and click “infringes my copyright” in the dropdown options.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/infringe-my-copyright-report.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Supply additional information to the report form, including the URL of the video infringing your copyrighted content and the URL of your own video.</li><li>Submit report and wait for an email confirmation that the infringing content has been removed.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match"><a href="#Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match"></a>Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match</h2><p>In 2018, YouTube launched a new feature called <strong>Copyright Match Tool</strong>, which automatically finds videos that are very similar or the same as the ones you’ve created. This gives you the power to determine what to do once you know the video exist.</p><p>- You can choose to do nothing.</p><p>- You can contact the publisher.</p><p>- You can report the video to YouTube for removal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528700/16446" target="_top" id="1528700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528700/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><p>I hope this article has clarified what you can and cannot do with copyrighted content.

videos. Sony’s Cyber-shot series is famous for its cutting-edge features and the DSC-RX 100 V model is not an exception. This camera is equipped with a 20.1 MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor that supports ISO sensitivities up to ISO 12800. You can record footage in UHD 4K at 30 or 24 fps, although with a five-minute limit, as well as Full HD videos at a maximum of 960 fps when recording in the HFR mode. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX 100 V ships with a non-interchangeable Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T lens that performs well under low-light conditions and in broad daylight. The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording. DSC RX-100 V’s multi-functionality makes it one of the best cameras for daily vlogging, especially for vloggers who are planning on shooting vlogs in various locations.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Light and easy to carry around</em> <em>- Produces high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Short battery life</em> <em>- Lacking a touchscreen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best cheap vlogging camera: Canon EOS M100 Canon’s EOS M100 is small and powerful.

The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 7 image processor ensure that your vlogs are always in focus and rich in detail. The Canon EOS M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options, offering ISO values as high as 25600, making it a great option for vloggers that often shoot their videos under difficult light conditions. The 3-inch touchscreen LCD lets you control focus points, navigate through the camera’s menu, or watch videos you’ve created. The screen can also be tilted in the upward direction to provide you a better preview of the shot you’re recording. The camera has a built-in Wi-Fi with NFC so you can transfer your videos seamlessly to a computer and have fun in the process. The Canon EOS M100 is currently one of the best entry-level cameras for daily vlogging on the market because it produces videos in great picture quality that you don’t have to spend a fortune for.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Affordable</em> <em>- Great connectivity options</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Lacks advanced video recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png"                      alt="Canon M100"                ></td><td>Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 wins this category as well in our books because it’s a powerful, feature-rich camera that’s also very affordable.

This camera uses the Canon EF lens mount, so you can choose the lens that best suits your needs. The Canon EOS M50 can capture UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps, and it also lets you record 120 fps slow-motion videos at 720p.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Has an external microphone port</em> <em>- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No image stabilization</em> <em>- Battery life could be longer</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png"                      alt="Panasonic GH5S"                ></td><td>Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic’s GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world’s first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That’s why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera’s 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There’s very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800</em> <em>- High video bit rates</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Expensive</em> <em>- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price.

This camera can capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, and it features a 9-point AF system and dual pixel CMOS AF technologies that provide precise and quick focusing even when there is not much light.

The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D’s 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself.

It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions.

It is to see from these statistics why every video aspiring YouTubers post on their channels has to be perfect in every way in order to reach a wide audience. Fortunately, trimming a video even after you’ve uploaded it to YouTube is a quick and easy process, and in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods you can use to trim the videos you upload to YouTube.

This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.</p><p>Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your <strong>profile picture</strong> and select the <strong>YouTube Studio (Beta)</strong> option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like <strong>Analytics, Dashboard or Videos</strong>, so just click on the <strong>Videos</strong> option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Editor</strong> option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube videos after uploading "                ></p><p>Click on the <strong>Trim button</strong> to start trimming the video and drag the <strong>blue bars</strong> located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove. Preview the changes and confirm what you’ve made by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button located in the upper right corner of the screen and the new shortened version of the video will become available within a couple of hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-save-video-trimming-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio - Trim YouTube videos after uploading "                ></p><p>In this way, you don’t need to take down the original video, edit it and re-upload.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352557/5172" target="_top" id="352557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352557/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>Trim tab</strong> is selected and then click on the <strong>Open File button</strong> to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use <strong>the trimming sliders</strong> to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the <strong>In and Out points</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Set In Point or Set Out Point icons</strong>. Click on the <strong>Export button</strong> to save the new version of the video clip and <strong>click OK</strong> to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instant-cutter-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Instant Cutter Tool"                ></p><h2 id="Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos"></a>Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</h2><p>In case you’re looking for a tool that lets you save extracts of scenes from YouTube to your computer free of charge <a class="link"   href="https://ytcutter.com/" >YT Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be one of your best options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yt-cutter-youtube-trimmer.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos online "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134218/18498" target="_top" id="2134218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134218/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This online video editing platform is remarkably easy to use since you just have to <strong>copy</strong> <strong>the link to the YouTube video</strong> you’d like to trim into <strong>YT Cutter’s URL box</strong> and then select how long the new video should be.

What’s wrong with simply focusing on ads?</p><p>More and more people are making a living by creating videos on YouTube. According to the <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2018/01/additional-changes-to-youtube-partner.html" >YouTube Partner Program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, YouTube has seen a 40% year-over-year of channels making 6 figures from viewer ads engagements.</p><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Video-Editor–Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Video-Editor–Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Video Editor–Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best YouTube Video Editor–Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Over thousands of hours of content are uploaded on YouTube every day and people are going crazy to earn money with video monetization. There should be a minimum time gap between your video shoot, editing, and uploading it to your channel. Wondershare Filmora Video Editor can help you get your videos edited faster. Not only the interface is simple and intuitive, it has both the basic and professional editing tools such as cutting, trimming, crop&amp;zoom, a large collection of video effects and royalty-free music, and you can also upload the video directly on YouTube after editing. All of these make Filmora stand out in the queue and become a favorite tool to edit YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-YouTube-Partner-Program-YPP"><a href="#What-is-the-YouTube-Partner-Program-YPP" class="headerlink" title="What is the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?"></a><strong>What is the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html" >YPP enables YouTubers to make money from an advertisement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that appears before or during their videos.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Money-Can-YouTubers-Make-from-Ads"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Can-YouTubers-Make-from-Ads" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Can YouTubers Make from Ads?"></a><strong>How Much Money Can YouTubers Make from Ads?</strong></h2><p>The answer to this question varies depending on the channel and the audience, as YouTubers don’t make money for views but rather from how often people engage with the ads. If a viewer watches more than 30 seconds of the ad or clicks it, then the YouTuber will make money.</p><p>This is a general estimate of how much a YouTuber can make from ads once they qualify:</p><p>- 68% of advertisers ad spend goes to the video creator. If advertisers spend $100, creators get $68.</p><p>- $0.18 is the average rate per ad view.</p><p>- 1000 ad views will equal approximately $18</p><p>- 1000 video views will equal between $2-$5</p><h2 id="Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads"><a href="#Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads"></a><strong>Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads</strong></h2><p>For new YouTubers, it is getting harder and harder to get to that point where their sole income can be from YouTube ads. Before they can make a penny, they must first qualify.</p><h4 id="Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018"><a href="#Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Rules (as of January 2018):"></a><strong>Monetization Rules (</strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/youtube-tightens-rukles/"><strong>as of January 2018</strong></a><strong>):</strong></h4><p>- Creators need 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of view time in 12 months before they can turn on monetization</p><p>- YouTube pays in $100 increments</p><p> Once they have monetization turned on, it’s only the beginning. YouTubers need to create good content consistently. In order to earn $100 for the initial payout, they need an average of 50,000 views. That’s just $100! A lot of views and not a big payout. Hardly enough to quit your day job.</p><p>That is why it is essential to have alternative ways to make money on YouTube, and not rely on the ads shown on your videos. So, without further ado, here are 4 other ways to make money on YouTube:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118325/7443" target="_top" id="2118325">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118325" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118325/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service"><a href="#1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service" class="headerlink" title="1.

Sell Your Product or Service:</strong></h2><p>YouTube is one of the most effective means of marketing and selling your products and services if you are able to use it effectively and drive people to click and buy.</p><p>Here are some examples of products and services you can offer:</p><h4 id="Products"><a href="#Products" class="headerlink" title="Products:"></a><strong>Products:</strong></h4><p>- eBooks</p><p>- Artwork</p><p>- Licensed content</p><p>- Online course</p><p>- Channel&#x2F;brand merchandise</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jack-paul1.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Jake Paul "                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Jake Paul uses eCommerce platform</em> <a href="https://fanjoy.co/collections/"><em>Fanjoy</em></a><em>to sell his merch.</em></p><h4 id="Services"><a href="#Services" class="headerlink" title="Services:"></a><strong>Services:</strong></h4><p>- Consulting work (strategy planner, financial advisor, etc.)</p><p>- Contracting work (designer, developer, etc.)</p><p>- Education (tutor, trainer, etc.)</p><p>- Performance&#x2F;Speaking Opportunities (motivational speaker, musician, etc.)</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sunny-lenarduzzi2.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Sunny Lenarduzzi"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber and entrepreneur, Sunny Lenarduzzi uses YouTube as a platform to get clients for her consulting business.</em></p><h4 id="How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube"></a><strong>How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube</strong></h4><p>YouTube is a vast platform and if you don’t have a clear direction for what you are selling, you might be making videos for an audience that isn’t interested in buying what you are selling.</p><p>Here is how you should go about selling your product or service on YouTube:</p><p> <strong>1. Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094415/7443" target="_top" id="2094415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094415/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well. Have a clear call to action somewhere on your website. This is where your viewers become customers.</p><h4 id="But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet"><a href="#But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet" class="headerlink" title="But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?"></a><strong>But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?</strong></h4><p>While some YouTubers certainly start with their product and service in mind and find their customers to sell through YouTube, many others go the opposite way and discover their audience first.</p><p>Lilly Singh did not start a YouTube channel to sell her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/How-Be-Bawse-Guide-Conquering/dp/0385689306"><em>How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life</em></a>. Her YouTube channel gave her an audience and proved to publishers that there was enough demand for her to write a book that people will read.</p><p> As you <a class="link"   href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/get-more-youtube-subscribers-increase-video-views/" >grow your audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will find that there will be a demand for certain products or services that don’t already exist. This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers. Remi created a beauty brand and DIY face mask, <a class="link"   href="https://shophoneypop.com/" >Honey Pop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which could only have happened after taking the time to understand her supportive audience.</p><h2 id="2-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#2-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="2. Affiliate Marketing:"></a><strong>2. Affiliate Marketing:</strong></h2><p>Businesses know that there are more eyes watching YouTube than ever — behind Google, YouTube is the second most popular place for people researching what to buy — and influencers and reviews are an effective method of getting sales. You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a><em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust. You wouldn’t buy a computer from a nutritionist and you wouldn’t buy vitamins from a gamer, so consider what you are an expert in and what products you have the most authority to speak about.</p><h4 id="What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?"></a><strong>What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h4><p>There are no restrictions on what will make a good affiliate marketing video, but there are best practices.</p><p>What’s important is understanding the purpose of the video.

Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5? What did they say?</p><p>“What do you need it for?”</p><p>We are more willing to give money if we know where it is going. Let your audience know exactly what you are planning to spend the funds on and how it will benefit them. One way to really encourage them is to have a goal, for example, a trip to a conference, and a special video will be produced to highlight the event.</p><h4 id="Set-a-Target"><a href="#Set-a-Target" class="headerlink" title="Set a $ Target"></a><strong>Set a $ Target</strong></h4><p>If you have a pie in the sky goal, you aren’t going to fully leverage the message to your audience. Understand how much money you need to produce a video or to pursue a more ambitious project.

The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p><p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying.

Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p><p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902294/19272" target="_top" id="1902294">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902294" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902294/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again" class="headerlink" title="6.

What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe.

There are thousands of webinar software products and online platforms, but most of them are quite expensive and they require you to have a considerable amount of experience with the process of setting up and recording webinars.</p><p>An alternative solution is available if your budget is tight, but you’d still like to produce a great webinar. We are going to take you through all the steps you’ll need to take if you’d like to host a webinar for free and help you spread the word about the products and services you’re offering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044585/7443" target="_top" id="2044585">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044585" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044585/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hosting-a-Webinar-for-Free"><a href="#Hosting-a-Webinar-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Hosting a Webinar for Free"></a>Hosting a Webinar for Free</h2><p>The world’s largest video sharing platform also features broadcasting options that enable its users to schedule events and thus host webinars free of charge. Previously known as the Google Hangouts on Air, the YouTube Live feature is fairly simple to set up, but before you start your first webinar you will need to choose a landing page and a chatbox. If you already have a website you can simply copy and paste the embed link and create a landing page for your webinar, or you can use landing pages software products such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.leadpages.net/" >LeadPages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://unbounce.com/" >Unbounce <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you don’t have your own online domain. For setting up chatboxes for your webinars we recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://chatroll.com/" >Chatroll <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.rumbletalk.com/" >RumbleTalk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> platforms, although you’ll have to pay a fee if you choose to chat with your audience using these computer programs. So here’s how you can host your first webinar on YouTube for free.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Create-a-YouTube-Event"><a href="#Step-1-Create-a-YouTube-Event" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Create a YouTube Event"></a>Step 1. Create a YouTube Event</h4><p>If you don’t already have an account on YouTube, you’ll have to create one before you can schedule your first live event. After making sure that you are logged in to your YouTube account head over to the Creator Studio, and click on the Live Streaming tab. Select the New Live Event option and proceed to insert the basic information about the event such as the title, date when the event should take place, tags or a short description of the webinar you’re planning.</p><p>The Advanced Settings tab will enable you the access to options that will allow you to assign the license and the owner of the webinar. You can also choose the language, set the location or select the category of the event.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Copy-the-Embed-Code-and-Paste-it-To-Your-Webinar’s-Landing-Page"><a href="#Step-2-Copy-the-Embed-Code-and-Paste-it-To-Your-Webinar’s-Landing-Page" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Copy the Embed Code and Paste it To Your Webinar’s Landing Page"></a>Step 2. Copy the Embed Code and Paste it To Your Webinar’s Landing Page</h4><p>When you adjust all the settings for your upcoming event, you should click on the Share button. This action will grant you access to the video’s embed link, so you can just copy it to your website, or to the landing page you’ve created with the appropriate software.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Add-the-Chatbox-to-The-Webinar’s-Landing-Page"><a href="#Step-3-Add-the-Chatbox-to-The-Webinar’s-Landing-Page" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Add the Chatbox to The Webinar’s Landing Page"></a>Step 3. Add the Chatbox to The Webinar’s Landing Page</h4><p>Communicating with the audience during the webinar is important, and for that reason, embedding the chatbox link on the webinar’s landing page is a crucial step that will allow you to interact with the participants of your webinar. Chatbox platforms for live events such as <a class="link"   href="https://chatroll.com/" >Chatroll <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or RumbleTalk offer amazing features, but they cannot be used for free, which means that you’ll have to invest a certain amount of money in order to include a chatbox in your webinar.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Publish-the-Webinar’s-Landing-Page-and-Get-the-URL"><a href="#Step-4-Publish-the-Webinar’s-Landing-Page-and-Get-the-URL" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Publish the Webinar’s Landing Page and Get the URL"></a>Step 4. Publish the Webinar’s Landing Page and Get the URL</h4><p>Making the event public a week or a few days before it takes place will provide you with enough time to promote it. Include the webinar’s landing page URL in the promotional social media posts and make sure to send out invites for your webinar to your friends and colleagues. Email marketing methods can help you get a larger number of attendees, which is the reason why investing time in the promotion of your webinar can prove to be extremely beneficial.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Start-your-Webinar"><a href="#Step-5-Start-your-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Start your Webinar"></a>Step 5. Start your Webinar</h4><p>Hit the Go Live Now button, when you are ready to start your first webinar and enjoy sharing your skills and knowledge with your audience. Even though YouTube offers a simple way to host webinars for free, it lacks the advanced options that enable you to use the prerecorded footage, keep track of the webinar’s analytics or create virtual whiteboards and polls.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 Best Free Video Hosting Sites for Private&#x2F;Business Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528681/16446" target="_top" id="1528681">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528681" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528681/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-swift-streaming-on-instagram-mobile-and-online-secrets/"><u>[New] In 2024, Swift Streaming on Instagram Mobile & Online Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-best-tools-and-techniques-adding-frames-to-digital-images-2023-edition-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best Tools & Techniques - Adding Frames to Digital Images, 2023 Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-high-engagement-stories-filters-list/"><u>[Updated] High-Engagement Stories Filters List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-crafting-content-for-specific-youtube-subsets/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crafting Content for Specific Youtube Subsets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-accessing-global-hitters-the-1-6-short-video-downloaders/"><u>2024 Approved Accessing Global Hitters The #1-#6 Short Video Downloaders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-achieving-broadcast-excellence-your-guide-to-youtubes-live-360-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Achieving Broadcast Excellence Your Guide to YouTube's Live 360 Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-impactful-video-campaigns-for-startups/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Impactful Video Campaigns for Startups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/achieving-youtube-live-prominence-with-pro-level-tips/"><u>Achieving YouTube Live Prominence with Pro-Level Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/amplify-your-voice-on-youtube-mastery-through-tubebuddy-for-2024/"><u>Amplify Your Voice on YouTube - Mastery Through TubeBuddy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ing-creativitys-canvas-youtube-vs-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>Choosing Creativity's Canvas Youtube Vs.

Or, do you like to Livestream? These are two perks of having a YouTube account in good standing. You can lose these privileges, have your ability to post videos frozen, and even have your account terminated if you start accumulating strikes.</p><p>If you receive a strike, you will usually be able to get rid of it. This article will show you how.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><p><a href="#strikes">1. Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#wrong">2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#community">3.

Your account and all your videos will be deleted if you get three of either one of these types of strikes, but YouTube is fair about how these strikes are given out and how you can reverse them.</p><h2 id="1-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#1-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1. You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123748/7443" target="_top" id="2123748">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123748" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123748/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides.

Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks. If you receive a third strike before either of your previous strikes has expired, your account will be terminated.</p><p> Have you experienced a copyright strike against your YouTube channel?

Businesses use FameBit to find the perfect video creators – or ‘digital influencers’ – to help with their marketing campaigns.</p><p>Until your channel is huge it is difficult to make a significant amount of money through ad revenue on YouTube. Creating branded content is one way in which YouTubers with small or mid-sized channels can generate income.</p><p>Finding sponsorships and negotiating with brands can be tricky. So can integrating products and brand messages in your videos without making your audience feel like you have ‘sold out’. This guide will help.</p><p>You must have at least 5,000 subscribers to join FameBit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-famebit-find-youtube-sponsorship.jpg"                      alt="Use FameBit to Find YouTube Sponsorship"                ></p><h2 id="How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Can You Make"></a>How Much Money Can You Make</h2><p>How much money you can make on FameBit will depend on the deals you can negotiate with brands, and those deals will depend on how many subscribers you have and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how many views you usually receive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>When calculating your fee, FameBit suggests thinking of it in terms of ‘cost per view’ (CPV). Most creators on FameBit charge between $0.05 and $0.10 per view. If you charge $0.05 per view and you get an average of 10,000 views per video then you would charge a brand $500 for your services.</p><p>How much you should charge per view depends on your genre and the nature of your audience. If you often mention products you like in videos and your subscribers have come to trust your recommendations, then it makes sense for you to charge more per view than a creator whose audience will be less receptive to product placement.</p><p>For example, if you do makeup tutorials then viewers will be used to hearing about your favorites. This makes your 10 000 views more valuable than 10 000 views on a ranting vlog channel whose subscribers are not tuning in to hear about products.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1167086/14483" target="_top" id="1167086">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1167086" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1167086/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money With FameBit"></a>How to Make Money With FameBit</h2><h4 id="Finding-Sponsorships"><a href="#Finding-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Finding Sponsorships"></a>Finding Sponsorships</h4><p>Brands post details about their upcoming campaigns, and the types of creators they are interested in working with, on FameBit.</p><p>While you are browsing through the available campaigns, think of the types of brands you would be excited to work with as well as which ones make sense for your channel.</p><p>If you host a lifestyle vlog about staying healthy, for example, and there is an opportunity to work with a brand that sells a type of healthy snack then it is your responsibility to look into the company and the product before you sign on to work with them. Is the snack healthy, and do you enjoy it?</p><p>Ideally, you will want to find brands that share your values and which are selling products you feel good about recommending to your subscribers.</p><p>Once you find a few campaigns you are interested in creating videos for, it’s time to write your proposals and negotiate with your potential sponsors.</p><h4 id="Negotiating-with-Sponsors"><a href="#Negotiating-with-Sponsors" class="headerlink" title="Negotiating with Sponsors"></a>Negotiating with Sponsors</h4><p>When you want to be part of a campaign a brand has posted, you send them a proposal.</p><p>Be creative and detailed in the proposals you write. The best brands will value you for our ideas and creativity, and this will give you an edge over creators who put less effort into their pitches. You also want to be detailed because you do not want to risk having a disagreement with the brand based on them misunderstanding what you were going to do.</p><p>Sometimes brands will have very specific things they want you to do or say in the video you make for them. It is your job to find ways of doing and saying these things that still feel natural within the context of your videos. On YouTube, even when you are representing a brand, you need to be authentically you.</p><p>If you feel like the things a brand wants from you will make your video come across as a tacky commercial and offend your loyal subscribers, and you cannot see a creative way around this, bring it up before you agree to work with them. Explain what you think should happen instead. If they are not willing to compromise, do not agree to work with them. Find a more reasonable brand to partner with.</p><p>If you offend your subscribers and they stop watching you then your channel will become less valuable to other potential sponsors. In the long run, there is no upside to agreeing to do a video that makes no sense for your channel.</p><p>Remember that even brands that like your ideas and get excited about your proposals will not be able to work with you if you do not meet their requirements in terms of subscribers and average views. There are a lot of campaigns on FameBit which are open to small or mid-sized channels, but there will always be minimum requirements. It makes no sense for a brand to pay you to make a video nobody will see, even if it is an amazing video. Sad, but true.</p><h4 id="How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience"></a>How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience</h4><p>Some of your subscribers will resent any branded content you create and there is no way around that. These subscribers will be in the minority – most people understand that accepting sponsorship from brands helps their favorite YouTubers continue making great videos – but it is unavoidable that there will be a few.</p><p>Most of your subscribers will not be bothered by the idea of you partnering with a brand, so long as you go about it in the right way.</p><p>Firstly; be honest about your sponsorship. Do not pretend to be giving an objective opinion on a product when the company who makes it is paying you. Your viewers will know and they will be offended.</p><p>Secondly; incorporate the brand’s message or product into your videos in ways that feel natural. Do not stray too far from your usual video style. Ultimately every video you make, even branded content, is for your viewers. Make the kind of video they expect from you and mention the product or service you have agreed to in a place where it makes sense&#x2F;is on topic.</p><p>You want the branding in your videos to be subtle, but you never want to hide that it is there.</p><p>So long as you are honest and the more commercial elements of your video are not distracting, the vast majority of your subscribers – the ones you have built a real relationship with – will not mind.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037346/7443" target="_top" id="2037346">  <img

If you are a YouTube Partner, that means you are earning revenue from the ads being shown before and during your videos.</p><p>Before you dive into the below guide, you may need a video editor to start your monetizing on Youtube. Filmora video editor will be the best choice.</p><p>Becoming a skilled video editor takes years of practice, but with Wondershare Filmora video editor, you can produce YouTube videos that have a professional look and feel, even if you are new to the world of video editing. This YouTube Video Creator has big icons and an intuitive interface, so those YouTubers who edit videos for the first time can quickly make a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"                      alt="legend"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Qualifying-for-the-YouTube-Partner-Program"><a href="#Qualifying-for-the-YouTube-Partner-Program" class="headerlink" title="Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program"></a><strong>Qualifying for the YouTube Partner Program</strong></h2><p>In order to qualify for YPP, you need to prove that you’re creating consistent, original, content and that people are watching your content. YouTube believes that has been proven when you reach these qualifications:</p><ol><li>1000 Subscribers</li><li>4000 Hours of Watch Time (over the past 12 months)</li></ol><p>Not quite there yet? Here’s a list of actionable tips that can help you <a href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html"><strong>grow your channel</strong></a>.</p><p>If you meet these requirements and are approved for monetization, but then drop below them, your channel will not be automatically demonetized. YouTube may review your content and demonetize you if you seem to have stopped posting videos, but this will not be automatic.</p><p>Remember: meeting these milestones does not grant you automatic monetization.</p><p>You can apply for YPP when you reach the milestones above, but your channel will still need to be reviewed by a human working for YouTube. Reviewers will be watching for:</p><ol><li>Nudity or sexual content</li><li>Harmful, dangerous, threatening, or hateful content</li><li>Violent or graphic content</li><li>Harassment or cyberbullying</li><li>Spam, scams, and misleading metadata</li><li>Copyright infringement or impersonation</li><li>Privacy violations</li><li>Fake subscribers</li><li>Other guidelines violations</li></ol><p>If your content violates any of YouTube’s Community Guidelines you may be denied monetization.

You must be over 18 to create an AdSense account. YouTube creators under 18 can link to the AdSense accounts of their parents or guardians.</p><p>Here’s how to sign up for AdSense through YouTube:</p><ol><li>Under <strong>Channel &gt;</strong> <strong>Status and features</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, look for Paid content. Click where it says <strong>‘active AdSense account’</strong>.</li><li>On the following ‘Monetization’ screen, click <strong>Next</strong> to go to AdSense.</li><li>You will be asked whether you want to use the Google account you’re already signed in to for AdSense, or if you want to use a different account.</li><li>The next step is ‘Your Website’. This will automatically be filled in with your channel. Click <strong>Accept association</strong> if it’s right.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can only have one AdSense account. Do not make a second one if you already have one. Duplicate accounts may be banned, which will stop you from monetizing your videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135397/19272" target="_top" id="2135397">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135397" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135397/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-Ad-Friendly-content"><a href="#What-is-Ad-Friendly-content" class="headerlink" title="What is Ad Friendly content?"></a><strong>What is Ad Friendly content?</strong></h2><p>Not all content that meets YouTube’s Community Guidelines will be considered ‘advertiser-friendly’. Companies don’t want to run ads alongside content that doesn’t match the values of their brands.</p><p>YouTube may disable ads on any video it doesn’t think is ad-friendly. Videos which may be flagged as inappropriate for ads include (but are not limited to):</p><ol><li>Videos that cover controversial or sensitive subjects.</li><li>Videos depicting the use of drugs or dangerous products.</li><li>Videos may encourage harmful or dangerous behavior.</li><li>Videos with swearing (but not ALL videos with swearing – quantity and context are factors).</li><li>Videos which contain hate speech.</li><li>Videos that depict family entertainment characters (i.e. Disney princesses) engaged in inappropriate behavior (even if you’re being satirical).</li></ol><p>If you want to make sure all of your content is advertiser-friendly, here are some best practices suggested by YouTube:</p><ol><li>Be respectful of your viewers and any people or groups you may include or mention in your video.</li><li>Extend this respectful tone to your thumbnails and video titles, and make sure your thumbnails and metadata accurately depict your video’s content.</li><li>Don’t try to monetize videos that already contain ads (i.e. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/154235" >paid product placement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014848/22899" target="_top" id="2014848">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014848" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014848/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-Through-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid Through AdSense"></a><strong>How to Get Paid Through AdSense</strong></h2><p>In order to receive a payment from AdSense, you need to earn at least $100.</p><p>For example, if you only earn $10 in a month, you will not receive a payment that month. You will not lose that $10 – you will receive it when your total earnings reach or exceed $100.</p><p>You will also need to provide AdSense with tax information and verify your identity and address in order to start being paid.</p><p>The most popular way to get paid through AdSense is via an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). To receive your payments this way, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Log in to <a href="https://www.google.com/AdSense"><strong>AdSense</strong></a>.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong> in the menu on the left, and then select <strong>Payments</strong>.</li><li>On the Payments page, click <strong>Manage payment options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Add payment method</strong>.</li><li>You’ll be prompted to add your bank account details.</li><li>Make sure the name on your AdSense account matches the name on your bank account (if you’re under 18 and cannot make your own AdSense account, this may mean you’re using your parent or guardian’s bank account).</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Videos-Get-the-Highest-Paying-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?"></a><strong>Which YouTube Videos Get the Highest Paying Ads?</strong></h2><p>Not all ads pay the same, and not all videos will be able to attract the ads that pay the most.</p><p>How much money your video has the potential to earn depends on:</p><ol><li>The size of your channel</li><li>Your niche on YouTube</li><li>The specific topic of the video</li></ol><p>That the size of your channel matters probably isn’t a surprise. The biggest brands want to run their ads beside videos that are getting more views.</p><p>Whether or not your YouTube niche has a high potential for profit will depend on a couple things:</p><ol><li><strong>How many other channels are in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>The more people there are making similar videos to you, the thinner the available ads are spread.</p><ol><li><strong>How many cheap or expensive products are being advertised in your niche?</strong></li></ol><p>If the products are free or inexpensive (i.e. free online games) then that limits your earning ability. In large niches like gaming, the few higher paying ads will go to the most popular channels and the low-paying ads will be spread amongst everyone else.</p><p>If you have a very specific niche, i.e. luxury cars, then you will have less competition and the ads available will likely be for more expensive products (and thus the ads themselves will be higher paying).</p><p>Even if you are in a large niche, you can still make videos on specific topics designed to attract higher-paying ads and more revenue. Pay attention to the analytics in your Creator Studio to learn which of your videos earn the most. Then, make more videos on similar topics to boost your earnings.</p><p>Another factor that can affect what ads appear alongside your videos is the viewing habits of individual viewers. People are shown ads that YouTube believes are more relevant to their interests.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098704/14409" target="_top" id="2098704">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098704" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098704/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV"><a href="#Useful-Terminology-CPM-CPC-CPV" class="headerlink" title="Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)"></a><strong>Useful Terminology (CPM, CPC, CPV)</strong></h2><p>A lot of people think your ad revenue is determined by your view count. This isn’t true – it’s determined by ad impressions.</p><p>How much revenue you earn from the ads running around your videos depends on these three things:</p><p><strong>CPC:</strong> ‘cost per click’. Most of the ads on YouTube are CPC, meaning that an ad impression is only recorded when an ad is clicked on.</p><p><strong>CPV:</strong> ‘cost per view’. Skippable pre-roll ads are the only ads on YouTube which record ad impressions without clicks. These ads record ad impressions when viewers watch 30 seconds of the ad instead of skipping it.</p><p><strong>CPM:</strong> ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand’. This refers to how much money gets paid out for 1000 ad impressions.</p><p>Your CPM will be affected by a multitude of things including the ads themselves and the size of your channel. AdSense has made it a rule that you cannot disclose your CPM to anyone, which makes it difficult to determine what you should expect.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> never click on ads near your own videos or instruct your viewers&#x2F;friends to do so. If your clicks are higher than what AdSense considers normal they may ban you.</p><p>Sites like <a href="https://socialblade.com/"><strong>Social Blade</strong></a> provide estimated earnings for any channel you want to look up. Looking up channels that are where you plan to be in the near future could help you set your own expectations.</p><p>Are you able to monetize your videos?

He has done several collab videos and has a lot of advice about how to find potential partners. Here are 3 of his biggest tips:</p><h4 id="1-Approach-people-you-already-have-a-relationship-with"><a href="#1-Approach-people-you-already-have-a-relationship-with" class="headerlink" title="1. Approach people you already have a relationship with"></a>1. Approach people you already have a relationship with</h4><p>This could mean friends, people you have met at events like VidCon, or people who are subscribed to your channel. It is easier for someone to want to collaborate with you if they feel like they know you.</p><h4 id="2-Think-about-what-your-potential-partner-could-have-to-offer-your-existing-subscribers"><a href="#2-Think-about-what-your-potential-partner-could-have-to-offer-your-existing-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="2. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers."></a><strong>2. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers.</strong></h4><p>People sub to Roberto for tech advice, for example, so it makes sense for him to collaborate with people who have insights into technology. Collaborations should never be all about bringing in new subs – make your videos for the people who already watch your channel.</p><h4 id="3-Create-quality-content-consistently"><a href="#3-Create-quality-content-consistently" class="headerlink" title="3. Create quality content consistently."></a><strong>3. Create quality content consistently.</strong></h4><p>If you approach somebody about collaborating and they see that you haven’t posted in over a month, or that you don’t have many videos, it might be harder to get them to agree to work with you. The same goes if they watch your videos and don’t think they are at the same quality level as their videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047346/19272" target="_top" id="2047346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047346/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-From-YouTube-Guru-Nich-Nimmin"><a href="#Tips-From-YouTube-Guru-Nich-Nimmin" class="headerlink" title="Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin"></a>Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin</h2><p>This is a collab video about collab videos! <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCei6wyubYC1I1FwZ54LZFiA" >Nick Nimmin’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> channel is all about YouTube, and Brandon’s channel <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx%5Fiw" >OnePercentBetter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> has tons of cool self-development animations. It’s Brandon giving the tips in this video, and 3 of his best are:</p><h4 id="1-Use-the-person’s-name-when-you-contact-them"><a href="#1-Use-the-person’s-name-when-you-contact-them" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the person’s name when you contact them."></a><strong>1. Use the person’s name when you contact them.</strong></h4><p>This might seem obvious, but it is an easy mistake to make. If you send someone an email where you don’t use their name (maybe you just say ‘hey’) it will seem like you aren’t interested in them. Talking about a video of theirs you like can also help show your interest in them as a creator.</p><h4 id="2-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#2-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep it simple."></a><strong>2. Keep it simple.</strong></h4><p>When you’re approaching someone for the first time, don’t overwhelm them with a long email. Limit yourself to around two paragraphs.</p><h4 id="3-Have-ideas"><a href="#3-Have-ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Have ideas."></a><strong>3. Have ideas.</strong></h4><p>Don’t make your potential partner do the work of pitching ideas to you. Be open to their ideas, but come up with 1 or 2 ideas of your own you can mention when you approach the creator you want to work with. People will be more likely to say ‘yes’ to a specific idea than to the idea of collaborating in general, if they don’t already know you.</p><h2 id="Tips-From-Freelancer-Lifestyle-Vlogger-Amy-Schmittauer"><a href="#Tips-From-Freelancer-Lifestyle-Vlogger-Amy-Schmittauer" class="headerlink" title="Tips From Freelancer &#x2F; Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer"></a>Tips From Freelancer &#x2F; Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer</h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial/featured" >Amy Schmittauer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> of Savvy Sexy Social does vlogs, lifestyle videos, and provides tips on being a freelancer. After doing several collabs in one week, she posted this video about how collaborations work best and how you should approach people you might want to work with.</p><h4 id="1-Networking-is-important-in-finding-collab-partners"><a href="#1-Networking-is-important-in-finding-collab-partners" class="headerlink" title="1. Networking is important in finding collab partners."></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Networking is important in finding collab partners.</strong></h4><p>Be nice to other creators when you meet them, offline or online, and build real relationships. Amy got to collaborate with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee" >Marques Brownlee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (MKBHD) even though she had not met him before because <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duncan33303" >Austin Evans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> - who she had built a friendship with – vouched for her with him. When you are networking, think beyond what the immediate payoff could be.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-stray-too-far-from-your-other-content"><a href="#2-Don’t-stray-too-far-from-your-other-content" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t stray too far from your other content."></a><strong>2. Don’t stray too far from your other content.</strong></h4><p>Aim to make your collab videos similar, content-wise, to the other videos on your channel. That way the new viewers you get from having the guest YouTuber in your video will be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to subscribe to you.</p><h4 id="3-Thank-the-people-you-work-with-in-your-videos"><a href="#3-Thank-the-people-you-work-with-in-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Thank the people you work with in your videos."></a><strong>3. Thank the people you work with in your videos.</strong></h4><p>If you appeared in someone else’s video, you would probably appreciate it if they thanked you for being there, told their viewers to go check out your channel, and provided a link for them to do so. So, when you host someone else in one of your videos, that’s the kind of treatment you should give them. If you don’t, then the next person you want to collaborate with will see that and probably won’t want to work with you.</p><p> <em>Collab advice starts at around 2:10.</em></p><h2 id="Tips-From-Lifestyle-and-Fashion-YouTuber-MyLifeAsEva"><a href="#Tips-From-Lifestyle-and-Fashion-YouTuber-MyLifeAsEva" class="headerlink" title="Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva"></a>Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva</h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva/featured" >Eva Gutowski <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (MyLifeAsEva) is a lifestyle, fashion, and DIY YouTuber who has done numerous collaborations and believes in making real friends on YouTube. In the video above she shares some of her experiences and talks about how to come across as a real person when you approach other YouTubers about collaborating.</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-approach-other-YouTubers-as-a-‘fan’"><a href="#1-Don’t-approach-other-YouTubers-as-a-‘fan’" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t approach other YouTubers as a ‘fan’."></a><strong>1. Don’t approach other YouTubers as a ‘fan’.</strong></h4><p>If you want to be friends and collab partners, talk to other YouTubers as if you are their equal (which you are!). If you want to work with someone it’s probably because you like their videos, and there’s nothing wrong with saying so. Being all ‘omg, I love you, please subscribe to me too!’ isn’t likely to lead to a collab, though.</p><h4 id="2-Ask-questions"><a href="#2-Ask-questions" class="headerlink" title="2. Ask questions."></a><strong>2. Ask questions.</strong></h4><p>If you’re just trying to break the ice with someone, it is a good idea to as them a question – potentially about YouTube or one of their videos. This will give them something to engage with, and it’s also a good way to let them know you’re a YouTuber too.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Twitter"><a href="#3-Use-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Twitter."></a><strong>3. Use Twitter.</strong></h4><p>Twitter is the best place to make YouTube friends, in Eva’s opinion. It’s an easy place to casually introduce yourself and ask questions.</p><p> Do you have any of your advice on YouTube collaborations?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">

That doesn’t mean you have to take out a loan and spend thousands to purchase a brand new camera and all other gadgets that professional filmmakers use.</p><p>The smartest way to get started is to go through a list of <strong>necessary equipment for YouTube</strong> and check whether or not you already own some of it. Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important. If you can buy either a new camera or an external microphone, but not both, it might be better to go for the microphone. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here for advice on upping your audio quality without an external microphone. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Sound capturing is every bit as important for your success as your video feed. In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938682/19272" target="_top" id="1938682">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938682" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938682/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear"></a>Smartphone Camera Gear</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1172027/12108" target="_top" id="1172027">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1172027" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1172027/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera. This inexpensive device will give you a lot of freedom to work in space, and allow you to make spectacular shots even without high-end YouTube equipment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span

The most important element is obviously you, the creator.

In fact, it should be simple. Your focus when you’re perfecting your video should be on that ‘most important thing’ we mentioned earlier – your creativity.

The interface is intuitive enough that you may not always need them, but having them should erase any confusion.</p><p>All of the basic editing features, like cutting clips up, are easy to access in the timeline. You have unlimited tracks, and it’s easy to drag your clips between them. There’s a helpful magnet feature that fits clips together if you slide them together, but which still allows for blank space if you choose to leave it.</p><p>Most other functions – setting volume levels, adjusting the speed, adding movement&#x2F;zoom effect – are accessible simply by right-clicking on your clip in the timeline and choosing what you want from the menu that pops up.</p><h4 id="Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-OpenShot-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is OpenShot Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>OpenShot is a great, free, choice for YouTubers at any editing skill level.</p><p>Beyond simply ordering your clips, OpenShot includes text and transition options within the program. You can even animate the text, and access Animated Titles if you use OpenShot in tandem with a free animation program called Blender. Titles and transitions are vital to a lot of popular YouTube styles.</p><p>OpenShot does not provide the same level of detail as the runner up, Shotcut, when it comes to color correction or audio editing. However, the features it does have (volume levels, control of saturation) will satisfy most YouTubers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934288/19272" target="_top" id="1934288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934288/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux"><a href="#2-Shotcut-–-Open-Source-Windows-Mac-Linux" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is not as easy to jump into as some of the other programs on this list, but it still only takes a half-hour or so of playing around to understand it well enough to make a video. There are also tutorials up on Shotcut’s site that can help you.</p><p>You can edit using multiple video tracks in Shotcut, making it easy to combine multiple clips, and basic functions like splitting or copying clips are as easy as clicking the right icon on the toolbar.</p><p>All of the video and audio effects, including things like chroma key, you might want to apply to your video are found under the Filters menu. It will look empty when you first open it, and you have to click the plus sign to see what your options are. If you want to create a color tint (like what you might think of as an Instagram filter) then you can do that through the Color Grading option. If you want to do something like invert your colors or add an ‘old film’ look, you’ll find that here as well along with all of the audio editing features (balance, bass and treble, and gain to name just a few).</p><h4 id="Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Shotcut-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Shotcut good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Shotcut good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Shotcut is a great choice for YouTubers. It allows you to do some advanced editing, and it’s easy to learn compared to a program targeted at professional editors.</p><p>The only complication with Shotcut for entry-level editors who will primarily use the program for YouTube might be that animations – like moving text – are not available through the program (you can add and customize text, but it just sits there). You can get them from elsewhere and use them in the program (Shotcut has an alpha channel), but it’s a bit more involved a process than simply customizing something that’s already provided.</p><h2 id="3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac"><a href="#3-Hitfilm-Express-–-Windows-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. Hitfilm Express – Windows, Mac"></a><strong>3. <a class="link"   href="https://hitfilm.com/express" >Hitfilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Windows, Mac</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Compositing mode (2D and 3D)</li><li>The Most effect customization</li><li>Helpful User Guide &amp; tutorials</li></ol><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Can be overwhelming</li><li>Its main strength is FX, but you only get a couple for free. Most have to be bought separately.</li></ol><h4 id="Hitfilm-Express-Review"><a href="#Hitfilm-Express-Review" class="headerlink" title="Hitfilm Express Review"></a><strong>Hitfilm Express Review</strong></h4><p>Hitfilm Express is the best free editor if you want to add special effects to your projects. OpenShot’s alpha channel will be enough for most people, but if you think of yourself as an aspiring filmmaker then it’s hard to beat Hitfilm’s range of functions.</p><p>This is an editor designed for people who want to make movies, and it’s a lot more intuitive than most professional-grade software. Film-quality FX (lasers, explosions, etc.) are available through Hitfilm Express for a reasonable price ($10-$50, depending on what you want), and even without paying extra for the packs, there’s a lot you can do to give your video a ‘film look’ using compositing layers and the multitude of customizable effects provided through the program.</p><p>Another highlight of Hitfilm Express is the extensive selection of tutorials and helpful information they have available both through YouTube videos and their User Guide. You will need those because this program can be overwhelming. It has so many functions and areas you can customize that it is easy to get lost.</p><p>That said, basic editing in Hitfilm Express is not difficult to jump into. It’s only when you start getting fancy that things get dicey.</p><h4 id="Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Hitfilm-Express-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Hitfilm Express good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Yes. It will not be the best option for everyone, but it’s not a bad option for anyone either.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog where you have a series of clips, and intro, and maybe a couple of title effects, then Hitfilm express might be overkill. You don’t want to have to master compositing just to add some text.</p><p>If what you want to make is a vlog that’s interrupted by an alien invasion and turns into an action sequence with lasers and falling debris, it’d be hard to do better than Hitfilm Express.</p><h2 id="4-VideoPad-Video-Editor-–-Windows"><a href="#4-VideoPad-Video-Editor-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="4. VideoPad Video Editor – Windows"></a><strong>4. <a class="link"   href="http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html" >VideoPad Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Windows</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Easy to jump into</li><li>Moving text</li><li>Huge audio waveforms</li><li>Audio and visual effects</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>No longer updated</li></ol><h4 id="VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#VideoPad-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="VideoPad Video Editor Review"></a><strong>VideoPad Video Editor Review</strong></h4><p>VideoPad Video Editor is an extremely easy to use program. It may be the easiest program on this list to jump into, which you could also realistically create your entire video inside (there are easier programs, but you can only do some of your work in them). Part of its simplicity comes from not being as feature-rich as the programs ranking higher than it on this list, however.</p><p>You do not get the same range of functions with VideoPad as you do from the top 3 free editors, but it has enough to satisfy people who are just starting out. Creating moving text effects is easy, you have huge audio waves to work with while you’re syncing, and effects like transitions and filters are easy to find.</p><p>VideoPad does suffer a bit from being dated. This program is no longer being worked on, and the interface doesn’t look particularly modern. This is a bit more than a cosmetic issue because some features, while not difficult to find, are placed a bit oddly compared to other editors.</p><p>One slightly annoying feature of VideoPad is that it will prompt you to buy the commercial version sometimes (the free version is only for non-commercial use). There have been reports of exports being blocked in the free version, but I exported several times for the sake of this review and the issue never came up.</p><h4 id="Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VideoPad-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VideoPad Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>VideoPad makes a decent YouTube editor. You can jump right in and start making cuts, adding filters, and ordering your clips. If you have the kind of channel where voiceovers are important (like in gaming or makeup), then you’ll be happy with the size of the audio waves you have to work with for syncing.</p><p>The thing about VideoPad is that you’re probably going to outgrow it quickly as you become a more capable editor.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux"><a href="#5-Lightworks-–-Windows-Mac-Linux" class="headerlink" title="5.

This is true if you compare it to other professional-level editing suites. Compared to the other programs on this list, Lightworks is complicated.</p><p>The first thing I attempt when I review this program is to simply split a clip, and it took me a ridiculous amount of time to figure this feature out in Lightworks (a more advanced editor could have found it faster, but these reviews are meant to help people with less experience). Lightworks does have a whole tutorial series on using the software, so if you are interested in learning to use it there is ample material out there to help you.</p><p>Lightworks has a wide range of functions (i.e. detailed audio editing and color correction), and it has been used for big movies like ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’. It is the most professional program on this list, and it’s a great free alternative to something like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p><em>Note:</em> there is no time limit on the free version of Lightworks, but it will ask you to renew your free license every 7 days. When it says your license is ‘expired’ it isn’t kicking you off the free version, you just need to renew.</p><h4 id="Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Lightworks-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightworks good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Lightworks good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Whether or not Lightworks is right for your YouTube channel depends on your goals as a video editor.</p><p>If what you want is to jump in and start making YouTube videos quickly, Lightworks might not be a great choice. It’s not an easy program to just jump into, you’ll have to either take time to learn it or accept that it’ll take some trial and error to get the hang of.</p><p>If what you want is to become a professional-level video editor, then Lightworks is a great program to start on (although, Hitfilm Express may still be better). Taking the time to learn it could certainly pay off in the long run.</p><p>However, if one of your priorities is for your YouTube channel to come across as professional, then the free version of Lightworks does have some disappointing limitations. You can only export videos in 720p, which is lower quality than viewers on YouTube expect (you probably want at least 1080p). Your output format is limited too. The royalty-free audio and video content Lightworks offers are also not free; you can just buy them through the program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows"><a href="#6-VSDC-Video-Editor-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="6.

Accessing even the most basic features is confusing.</p><p>One of the first things I tried to do as I tested the program was make a jump cut (where you cut out part of a video so the playback ‘jumps over’ the deleted segment) and, while I was able to do it, it was not an intuitive process. There is a multitude of toolbars and icons surrounding your preview window in VSDC, and none of those icons was for making cuts to your clips. To make any cuts you have to find the ‘cutting and splitting’ option under the Editor tab at the top of the page, which will open a second window in which you still cannot make any cuts. Instead what you can do is place markers, and when you click ‘apply changes’ to exit the window cuts will be made where you placed markers. There is nothing in the window to explain what the markers are for.</p><p>Other basic functions, like adding text, are just as complicated.</p><h4 id="Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-VSDC-Video-Editor-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is VSDC Video Editor good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>I would not recommend VSDC for YouTube. It ranks higher than two other items on this list because they are, do to functional limitations, unable to create full YouTube videos without the support of other programs (at least realistically). You certainly could create your full YouTube video in VSDC, but it’d be a headache.</p><h2 id="7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows"><a href="#7-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-–-Windows" class="headerlink" title="7. Machete Video Editor Lite – Windows"></a><strong>7. <a class="link"   href="http://www.machetesoft.com/home/about-machete-video-editor-lite.html" >Machete Video Editor Lite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – Windows</strong></h2><h4 id="Pros-6"><a href="#Pros-6" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a><strong>Pros</strong></h4><ol><li>Great for harvesting clips from longer footage</li><li>Lossless exports</li></ol><h4 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a><strong>Cons</strong></h4><ol><li>Cannot swap or add audio</li><li>Only supports two formats (AVI and WMV)</li><li>Slightly awkward timeline</li></ol><h4 id="Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review"><a href="#Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-Review" class="headerlink" title="Machete Video Editor Lite Review"></a><strong>Machete Video Editor Lite Review</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite claims that you’ll be able to edit your videos “within a few minutes after downloading the program, even if you’ve never edited a video before”, and that is true. It might even be better if you haven’t edited a video before because the interface is slightly awkward if you’ve come from a program with a more traditional timeline setup. Machete Lite is easy to use for the most part, but it doesn’t work like most other editors and that can be awkward to navigate around.</p><p>Instead of seeing a timeline with all of your individual clips, Machete treats your entire video as one clip. You will only be able to see where you have inserted a separate video clip or cut out a portion of the video by watching the video back or jumping through it (Machete Lite does allow frame-by-frame scrolling). You won’t be able to see this information at a glance, and you won’t be able to adjust the lengths of clips you’ve added separately.</p><p>To take out any portion of your overall video you’ll need to find a keyframe at the beginning, set that as the beginning of your selection, then find a key frame at the end and set that as the end of your selection. You will then be able to delete that selection. This will not work if the frames you have set as the beginning and end are not considered keyframes by the program, so it can be difficult to be precise, but since the program allows you to jump through keyframes it’s not difficult to find a point that works.</p><h4 id="Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Machete-Video-Editor-Lite-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Machete Video Editor Lite good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Machete Lite is not a good choice for YouTubers unless it is used in combination with another program.</p><p>It doesn’t work as a YouTube editor because you cannot edit or swap audio, the transition between clips, or create layers of videos and images.</p><p>However, the thing Machete Lite is really good at is cutting out clips from longer videos. You can create a selection of a part of your longer clip and then export it (with no quality loss) as its own video file.</p><p>This is what the Machete Lite toolbar looks like when you’ve created a selection. Tools like cut and copy which were greyed out before are now available, as is the save icon on the far right. If you click the save icon, you’ll be able to save that selection as its own video.</p><p>You can’t create a complete YouTube video in Machete Lite, but you can harvest clips to use in a different program.</p><h2 id="8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD"><a href="#8-Avidemux-–-Windows-Mac-Linux-BSD" class="headerlink" title="8.

If you decide to try it out, remember that you have to choose your output format before Avidemux will let you access tools like Hue&#x2F;Saturation and Contrast (click Filters under Video Output to find them).</p><p>There are no official tutorials for Avidemux you can access from their site, so you’ll have to rely on the forums and tutorials from users if you want to learn it.</p><p>You can import multiple clips into Avidemux, but you have to import them in the order you want because you can’t drag them around the timeline after. Everything becomes one big clip.</p><h4 id="Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube"><a href="#Is-Avidemux-good-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Is Avidemux good for YouTube?"></a><strong>Is Avidemux good for YouTube?</strong></h4><p>No. It has more functionality than Machete, which is ranked higher on this list, but the difference is that Machete is excellent at one thing. They both suffer from the same main weakness – you could not complete your full YouTube video either (at least not without a lot of trouble). Machete could still be useful to a YouTuber, though, because it allows for the lossless exporting of segments of clips. You can use it to harvest clips for your larger project in another program.</p><p>In theory, you could do some picture editing and snipping in Avidemux and then put your project together&#x2F;add titles in another program, but your other program can probably do all that just as well if not better. Avidemux isn’t a bad program, but it doesn’t excel at anything. There are a lot of better options which are also free.</p><p> What has your experience with free video editors been like?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-chromatic-brilliance-for-video-enthusiasts/"><u>[New] Chromatic Brilliance for Video Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-alternatives-to-blockbuster-flicks/"><u>2024 Approved Best Alternatives to Blockbuster Flicks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/comparing-youtube-policies-with-creative-commons-for-2024/"><u>Comparing YouTube Policies with Creative Commons for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-nokia-105-classic-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Nokia 105 Classic? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/echoes-of-excellence-10-strategies-for-superior-sound-quality/"><u>Echoes of Excellence 10 Strategies for Superior Sound Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/effortless-methods-to-discover-people-on-facebook-top-tips-included/"><u>Effortless Methods to Discover People on Facebook – Top Tips Included</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/enhancing-viewer-interest-with-accurate-time-stamping-for-2024/"><u>Enhancing Viewer Interest with Accurate Time Stamping for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-change-your-apple-id-email-address-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Guide on How To Change Your Apple ID Email Address On Apple iPhone 6 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/how-to-make-a-memorable-impact-with-youtubes-minis/"><u>How to Make a Memorable Impact with Youtube's Minis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplifying-tasks-with-ez-grabber-techniques/"><u>In 2024, Simplifying Tasks with EZ Grabber Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/latest-sound-blaster-z-driver-setup-for-windows-11-quick-and-simple-download-guide/"><u>Latest Sound Blaster Z Driver Setup for Windows 11 - Quick and Simple Download Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/review-of-elgoog-your-complete-resource-for-googles-mirror-site-insights/"><u>Review of elgooG: Your Complete Resource for Google's Mirror Site Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/stretching-issues-cleared-for-win11-screens/"><u>Stretching Issues Cleared for Win11 Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/thumbnail-tutorial-for-youtube-using-mobile-devices/"><u>Thumbnail Tutorial for YouTube Using Mobile Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-on-lava-blaze-curve-5g-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide on Lava Blaze Curve 5G FRP Bypass</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p><p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p><ol><li><a href="#make">How to Make a YouTube Thumbnail</a></li><li><a href="#upload">How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</a></li><li><a href="#makers">YouTube Thumbnail Makers</a></li><li><a href="#clicks">How to Make Thumbnails that Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</a></li><li><a href="#gif">Animated YouTube Thumbnails</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 1: How to Make a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>In order to create a custom video thumbnail, you’ll need a program to put it together in. You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p><p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-youtube-thumbnail-layout.jpg"                      alt="Popular YouTube Thumbnail Layout"                ></p><h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p><p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p><p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p><p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p><p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p><p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p><p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p><p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p><h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p><p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p><p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p><p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p><h4 id="3-Put-It-Together"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p><p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p><p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p><ol><li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li><li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li><li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li><li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol><p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p><p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p><p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148636/16836" target="_top" id="2148636">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148636" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148636/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p><p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p><p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p><p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p><p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p><p>Click to check more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p><h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p><p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p><p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p><p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p><h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p><p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p><h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p><p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982596">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982596">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982596%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982596/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p><p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser.
