The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.</p><h2 id="The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos"></a>The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/learn-gaming-video-editing-skills-banner.png" >Wondershare Filmstock Gaming Video Editing Skils <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source_channel=seo_article&spm=rs.filmora_web" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle&amp;spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="1-Panzoid"><a href="#1-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="1. Panzoid"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://panzoid.com/" >Panzoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This is an online platform that features hundreds of templates created by the platform’s users. Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Blender"><a href="#2-Blender" class="headerlink" title="2. Blender"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, Windows, macOS</p><p>Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.</p><h4 id="3-Renderforest"><a href="#3-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="3. Renderforest"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.renderforest.com/" >Renderforest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.</p><h4 id="4-MotionDen"><a href="#4-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="4. MotionDen"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://motionden.com/" >MotionDen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,00</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy. There are hundreds of templates organized in categories and you just have to go to YouTube Intros category and select the intro you’d like to add to your YouTube video. You must create an account on the MotionDen platform, if you want to customize your videos before you download them. Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.</p><h4 id="5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube"><a href="#5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="5.

There are over 4000 free intro templates to choose from that are organized around themes such as Game, Nature City or Timelapse and there are a number of styles available so you can try out 3D or Glitch intros. The app also features more than a hundred royalty-free songs, as well as a diverse collection of sound effects you can add to the intros you customize. The app’s text editing capabilities are remarkable since you can animate the text with twenty different animations, change a font or control the shadows. The only downside is that you are going to have to make in-app purchases if you want to unlock all the features the app has to offer.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Dimensions&#x2F;Size: Guide for Upload Settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Making the videos you share on your YouTube channel more dynamic and visually dynamic doesn’t have to be a process that takes hours of hard work, because you can use a template that can be quickly customized to match the visual style of your video.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>.

However, it is better to complete the entire video editing process before you upload a video to your YouTube channel because YouTube Studio and other online video editing platforms still offer only a limited amount of video editing tools.

But even though other forms of creative expression, like art and writing, may reflect something about the personhood of their creator, very few forms of creative expression seem to shine as much of a spotlight on who you are as a person as vlogging.</p><p>When it comes to vlogging, it is your face, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >voice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thoughts, and feelings that your audience sees and hears close-up. That is why vlogging can seem even more terrifying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-fear.jpg"                      alt="Vlogging Fears"                ></p><p>Below is a list of 10 of the most common fears people have with vlogging and ways to overcome them.</p><h3 id="1-Fear-of-Looking-Stupid-Talking-To-Your-Camera"><a href="#1-Fear-of-Looking-Stupid-Talking-To-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera"></a>1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera</h3><p>It can be nerve-racking to talk to your camera in public, especially if your vlog set-up attracts a lot of attention (Casey Neistat’s famous rig consisting of a DSLR camera with a GorillaPod tripod and a Rode shotgun mic attached to it definitely attracts more attention than just your everyday smartphone). Despite a lot of vloggers suggesting that people don’t care as much as you think they care, it still is an activity that stands out, gets noticed, and creates curiosity, which is plenty to feel nervous about.</p><p>My advice is to start with shorter conversations with your camera in public and gradually build your way up to longer ones or save all your longer talks for when you’re in a more private setting. Short conversations may include one simple sentence about where you are going. Then, in another separate recording, in a different setting with different people, you can explain why you’re going there. If you’ve never broken up your speech like this for your vlogs, you might wonder if this will make your vlogs look disjointed. But this is actually a technique (below) that can enhance your vlogs.</p><p>As you continue to vlog in public more, you’ll become increasingly comfortable with it.</p><h3 id="2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others"><a href="#2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others" class="headerlink" title="2. Fear of Being Judged by Others"></a>2. Fear of Being Judged by Others</h3><p>After uploading your vlog online, the next thing you might worry about is being judged and criticized by anonymous haters on the internet. No matter how perfectly you present yourself, this will happen. But you will be ok.</p><p>You just need to be strongly grounded in your intrinsic worth and not take too seriously the judgments of those who don’t even know you. You can adjust your community settings on YouTube so that you have more control over others’ comments. But I suggest you just get used to others’ disapproval because it’s something that comes with putting yourself out there on such a public platform.</p><h3 id="3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough"><a href="#3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough"></a>3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough</h3><p>A lot of people fear that they aren’t interesting enough to watch. This fear stops many people from vlogging. Some people get around this self-doubt by focusing their content on something other than themselves. But people are so much more interesting than the tools and objects that they test out and review on YouTube. Even if you’re unable to secure the interest of the masses, there are bound to be a handful of people from all around the world who do find you interesting.</p><h3 id="4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough"><a href="#4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough"></a>4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough</h3><p>When you look at the vlogs of many of the top YouTubers, their lives appear so action-packed. It’s hard not to think that all vlogs are meant to be very stimulating. But if you believe that that is the standard for vlogs, you might either be discouraged and drop vlogging altogether or you might try too hard to schedule your life around getting stimulating vlog content. Neither is a good option. Face your fear of your audience getting bored and just go ahead and vlog your lifestyle just as it is.</p><h3 id="5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity"><a href="#5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity" class="headerlink" title="5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity"></a>5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity</h3><p>When you have the ability to control what others see, you may be tempted to present yourself and your life in the most likable way to avoid disapproval and rejection. But the further away from your true self that you fabricate your story, the more inauthentic you’ll feel. Embrace disapproval and rejection and understand that, no matter how perfectly you present yourself, you just can’t avoid disapproval and rejection. It’s going to happen no matter what! So you might as well present yourself just as you are.</p><h3 id="6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough"><a href="#6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough" class="headerlink" title="6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough"></a>6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough</h3><p>Fearing that your production quality won’t measure up is another common fear that holds people back from vlogging. Just get started and put something together with the equipment and skills you already have. Loosen up a bit on your rigid high standards and experience for yourself that the consequences of doing your best with what you have are not so bad. You will develop your equipment and skills as you get more and more into vlogging.</p><h3 id="7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big"><a href="#7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big" class="headerlink" title="7. Fear of Failing To Get Big"></a>7. Fear of Failing To Get Big</h3><p>Getting a lot of subscribers is a common end goal for many who go into vlogging. This goal can seem impossible to reach with how crowded the vlogosphere has become with so many ambitious vloggers who are competing for views and subscribers.</p><p>How can you know for sure that you won’t be wasting your time and effort trying? The truth is… you can’t know for sure. But dismissing all of your time and effort as a waste just because you’re not at the end yet will take away from the joy you could have with vlogging. Rather than focusing on getting big, focus on enjoying the process of vlogging.</p><h3 id="8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment"><a href="#8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment" class="headerlink" title="8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment"></a>8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment</h3><p>Whether you’re vlogging or not, living in the present moment can already be a challenge with a smartphone. When something exhilarating happens, many of us feel compelled to pull out our phone to capture it, only to experience that fleeting moment through a small preview screen.</p><p>Vlogging appears to take that to another level, especially if you’re using complicated equipment that takes more time to set up and if you’re trying to capture enough footage to produce an entire vlog out of one day. How could all that time devoted to capturing your footage not get in the way of your present moment?</p><p>Well, like all hobbies, activities, and passions, vlogging does take time and you’re going to have to accept that it does. You may not know it now, but after giving vlogging a try, you may discover that you really enjoy it. And if you do, you won’t worry about missing out on life just as a painter who happens to be in the middle of his painting during a sunset wouldn’t worry about the sunset he’s missing out on.</p><p>If, in the end, you realize you don’t enjoy vlogging, then at least you’re left with a documented piece of a memory that you can relive again and again, which can actually help you appreciate your past moments even more.</p><h3 id="9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable"><a href="#9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable" class="headerlink" title="9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable"></a>9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable</h3><p>Even though you might have learned to enjoy and be comfortable with vlogging, your vlogging might make others uncomfortable. You can still vlog while respecting others’ boundaries by having a conversation first, before you start vlogging, around whether or not they feel comfortable with appearing in your vlog. You can then make sure to exclude those from your vlog who are uncomfortable with appearing in your vlog.</p><p>Sometimes, though, as much as you try to exclude certain people from your vlogs, they might still end up in your footage. You might even find out after you’ve captured great footage that people do not want to be in your video. In these cases, you can always censor their faces out in editing.</p><h3 id="10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark"><a href="#10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark" class="headerlink" title="10. Fear of Permanently Leaving a Bad Mark"></a>10. Fear of Permanently Leaving a Bad Mark</h3><p>Anything you make public over the internet, including vlogging, comes with the risk of making a permanent mark that won’t go away, even if you try to delete your original content later. That can definitely be a scary thing.</p><p>Luckily, with vlogging, you still have a lot of control. In both filming and editing, you can choose to share whatever you’re comfortable with sharing with the rest of the world.</p><p>In post-production, you can use some video editing software to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >delete unwanted parts from the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> clip, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >blur the video background <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or adjust the video

As YouTube has added a new “slow motion” tool to its YouTube Editor, it does pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Here is a simple guide on how to add slow motion with it.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get Access to YouTube Video Editor. You can either go directly to the URL, which is <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/editor" >https://www.youtube.com/editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or click “Upload”&gt;”Edit” to the Video Editor tab.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag your video on the timeline and double click it. In the pop up window, you will see the “Slow Motion” option. Enable it and then select how slow you want the video to be. This applies the effect to the entire video that you’ve selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/youtube-slow-motion.png"                      alt="slow motion youtube video"                ></p><p>If you just want to slow down parts of the video, go back to the main editing tab, clip it from the original video using the slicing tool and add the slow-motion effect to that clip only. You can then arrange the different clips you have in the editor to create your final video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tick the option “Preview effects side-by-side” with original video and then you can see how the original video plays compared to the one you’ve slowed down. If you’re happy with the result, hit “Done” to save the settings.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Above are the 3 ways that you can watch a YouTube video in slow motion, and slow down YouTube videos. You can directly change the playback speed of the YouTube video on Youtube, or download the YouTube video first and then slow down the speed of the YouTube video with some video editing software for YouTube like Filmora.

Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.</p><p> These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let’s explore different ways of improving your video making skills.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos"></a>10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos</h2><p> All videographers agree that you shouldn’t come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.</p><h4 id="1-Write-the-Script"><a href="#1-Write-the-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Write the Script"></a>1. Write the Script</h4><p> Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don’t have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you’ll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don’t have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.</p><h4 id="2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included"><a href="#2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included" class="headerlink" title="2. Build the Set (Lighting included)"></a>2. Build the Set (Lighting included)</h4><p> Don’t leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can’t at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.</p><h4 id="3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Batteries Charged"></a>3. Keep Your Batteries Charged</h4><p> There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.</p><h4 id="4-Do-a-Microphone-Check"><a href="#4-Do-a-Microphone-Check" class="headerlink" title="4. Do a Microphone Check"></a>4. Do a Microphone Check</h4><p> Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That’s why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-microphone-for-youtuber-videos.html" >Check out the best microphone for YouTuber in 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition"><a href="#5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition" class="headerlink" title="5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition"></a>5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition</h4><p> The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.</p><p> This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you’ll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.</p><h4 id="6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode"><a href="#6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6.

YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.</p><p> By switching to portrait mode, you’ll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.</p><p> In case that you want to convert your portrait video to landscape, do not miss this article about <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/convert-portrait-video-to-landscape.html" >How to Convert A Portrait Video to Landscape. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises"><a href="#7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="7. Eliminate The Background Noises"></a>7. Eliminate The Background Noises</h4><p> Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Keep The Shot in Focus"></a>8. Keep The Shot in Focus</h4><p> You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won’t be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="9.

All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.</p><p> In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.</p><p> We have chosen some of the <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html" >best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.</p><p> The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video’s aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Videos without Any Software Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Hopefully, the tips we provided in this article are going to help you create better YouTube videos.

A fresh supply of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas is a necessary ingredient for a successful channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but generating that fresh supply of ideas is easier said than done. When you’re stuck, the best thing to do can be to keep your ideas simple. Focus on being engaging instead of on coming up with an original idea nobody’s ever tried – your video will be original because you’re the one doing it and you’re unique.</p><p>They say that less is more, so let’s have a look at how you can apply this principle to practice and create amazing YouTube videos from small ideas.</p><ol><li><a href="#one">Introduce Yourself</a></li><li><a href="#two">Vlog About Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#three">Express an Opinion</a></li><li><a href="#four">Review Anything</a></li><li><a href="#five">Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc.</a></li><li><a href="#six">What’s on Your Phone?</a></li><li><a href="#seven">Make a Slideshow</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Make a Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#nine">10 Things About You</a></li><li><a href="#ten">Video Rant</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-Introduce-Yourself"><a href="#1-Introduce-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduce Yourself"></a>1. Introduce Yourself</h2><p>Let the world know who you are and what you do. If you are planning on starting a YouTube channel, or if you’ve already been posting videos on a topic but haven’t formally introduced yourself, it’s a great idea to put some thought into an introduction video. Producing such a YouTube video will enable you to introduce yourself to your future subscribers and give them an idea as to what your channel is all about.</p><p>These kinds of videos make great channel trailers, and they’re a good way to highlight the topics you’ll be covering on your channel in the future.</p><h2 id="2-Vlog-About-Your-Day"><a href="#2-Vlog-About-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="2. Vlog About Your Day"></a>2. Vlog About Your Day</h2><p>Anything that happens during your day can become a topic for your YouTube vlog. Traffic jams, treacherous pets who keep stealing your shoes, or the ridiculous amount of things you had to do in a single day can all become topics for videos you upload to your YouTube channel. Being candid and spontaneous is a sure way to grab the attention of a viewer, but limiting the duration of a vlog to a few minutes is key to ensuring that viewers watch the video until the end.</p><p>Strive to make visually dynamic videos, because just sitting or standing and talking in front of a camera for a few minutes isn’t going to create much on-screen action.</p><h2 id="3-Express-An-Opinion"><a href="#3-Express-An-Opinion" class="headerlink" title="3. Express An Opinion"></a>3. Express An Opinion</h2><p>Social media culture has enabled us to receive news instantly and react to it in any way we want. If you didn’t like the latest update of your favorite video game, or if you’re excited about a line of makeup that’s coming out soon, make a video about it and share your opinion with the community that follows you on YouTube.</p><p>Opinion videos are great conversation starters. Expressing an opinion through a YouTube video can get you a lot of comments and even inspire others to take action.</p><p>You can express your opinions on virtually any topic, but being respectful while doing so is for the best if you don’t want to find yourself in a YouTube feud.</p><h2 id="4-Review-Anything"><a href="#4-Review-Anything" class="headerlink" title="4. Review Anything"></a>4. Review Anything</h2><p>Everywhere around you, there are items you can review. The Apple Watch and the latest season of Game of Thrones are equally good choices for a review video. However, when creating review videos you need to make sure that all the factual information you have is accurate, which is why it is much better to make review videos about topics you know a lot about.</p><p>Review videos can also be a source of revenue because a lot of companies sponsor YouTubers who review their products.</p><h2 id="5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc"><a href="#5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc" class="headerlink" title="5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc"></a>5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc</h2><p>Are you a Tarantino fan? Why not? When you are struggling to find inspiration for your videos, just think about the things you like. Your subscribers are interested in you, so they’ll be interested in knowing about your favorite movies or music albums. Books, movies, and music are an inexhaustible source of fresh ideas because there is always a new song or a film you can talk about in your video.</p><p>You can do a ‘my 5 favorite songs’ type of video, or talk in detail about just one favorite.</p><h2 id="6-What’s-on-Your-Phone"><a href="#6-What’s-on-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="6. What’s on Your Phone?"></a>6. What’s on Your Phone?</h2><p>There were over two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2017, and this number is only going to continue rising in the next couple of years. Furthermore, thousands of YouTubers are already producing unimaginable amounts of videos about the latest apps or smartphone devices.</p><p>Finding a way to talk about the apps you like to use the most can be a good idea if you want to attract more visitors to your YouTube channel. However, you need to be clear about whether this is a lifestyle or vlog-style video covering a topic that usually exists in the tech genre, or if you are a tech YouTuber, so as not to confuse your audience (you don’t want people to start expecting app reviews if that’s not what you usually do).</p><h2 id="7-Make-a-Slideshow"><a href="#7-Make-a-Slideshow" class="headerlink" title="7. Make a Slideshow"></a>7. Make a Slideshow</h2><p>There’s no need to constantly produce new videos because you can just take some royalty-free music and create a slideshow from your old or new photos. The slideshow format will certainly allow you to try something different on your YouTube channel, while the photos you use in the slideshow can create a clear picture of who you are and what you do for your viewers.</p><p>If you are a photography enthusiast you can also plan the entire slideshow in advance and then make a short video about how you created the images in the slideshow.</p><h2 id="8-Make-a-Tutorial"><a href="#8-Make-a-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="8. Make a Tutorial"></a>8. Make a Tutorial</h2><p>Education is our only hope for a better world so if you know how to do something well, don’t be afraid to share your knowledge. A tutorial is a powerful educational tool that enables you to guide people through the entire process of making origami, solving a complicated video editing problem, maintaining a motorcycle, or anything else.</p><p>YouTube channels that feature tutorials often have millions of followers, because YouTube is a popular place to go when you need information.</p><h2 id="9-10-Things-About-You"><a href="#9-10-Things-About-You" class="headerlink" title="9. 10 Things About You"></a>9. 10 Things About You</h2><p>Being open is important, so why not share 10 things about yourself you think your audience would find interesting or which you think are important for people to know. The top 10 things structure is often used in YouTube videos because it provides a clear rhythm to a video clip, and it enables you to gradually increase the tension as the video progresses.</p><p>These types of videos tend to create a better relationship with your audience because they make the viewer feel as if they know the person on the screen.</p><h2 id="10-Video-Rant"><a href="#10-Video-Rant" class="headerlink" title="10. Video Rant"></a>10. Video Rant</h2><p>Doing things when you are angry is usually a bad idea, but if you feel so strongly about a particular subject then creating a video rant can be a great idea. Rants don’t even have to be angry, they can be about something that puzzles you or something so great you just can’t get over it. These kinds of videos can get your YouTube channel a lot of comments, likes, and subscribers.</p><p>Don’t try to fake a rant, because they only work if they are natural. Scripting a video rant may be an interesting creative task, but genuine reactions are always more effective. If you want to deliver a more structured and planned video about a topic you feel strongly about, that’d be more like an opinion video.</p><p>Do you have any <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >easy video ideas for other creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to try?</p><h2 id="Start-Editing-Videos-with-Beginner-friendly-Software"><a href="#Start-Editing-Videos-with-Beginner-friendly-Software" class="headerlink" title="Start Editing Videos with Beginner-friendly Software"></a>Start Editing Videos with Beginner-friendly Software</h2><p>If you start your YouTube channel but have no video editing experience, Wondershare Filmora will definitely help you get over the problems.

Of the major developments made in the recent past is the introduction of Shorts. These short vertical videos have grown in popularity as more people view videos on their phones.

To do so, it’s essential to provide something unique and different to the viewer. Without providing them the content they are looking for, it is impossible to grow your channel and reach. Once your content is ready and you are getting many views, it is essential to make these potential viewers your permanent viewers. The animated subscribe button will help you achieve this goal. While your viewers are watching your videos, you must remind them about subscribing to your channel for receiving such incredible content in the future. Subscribe animation plays a vital role in converting your viewers into subscribers.</p><p>There are so many platforms on the internet from where you can get Youtube subscribe button animation free, and you can also purchase these subscribe png gifs. But creating your own animated subscribe button can make you stand out from the crowd and make your videos unique and exclusive. Because it enables you to design it the way you want according to your brand, so, let’s create your own subscribe animation using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><hr><h2 id="Step-By-Step-guide"><a href="#Step-By-Step-guide" class="headerlink" title="Step-By-Step guide"></a>Step-By-Step guide</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started,open Filmora X. On your upper left corner, click on the “Sample Colors,” select the Green color and drag it to Video Track into the timeline. We are using a Green background to easily remove it using the green screen feature in Filmora to use it in our future projects after exporting it, without creating it again. Adjust the duration of this track according to your requirement. In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png"                      alt="subscribe-button1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png"                      alt="subscribe-button2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now it’s time to design the subscribe png gif. Go to the Sample colors again and drag the red color into the time above the green background.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button3.png"                      alt="subscribe-button3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Double click on the red color in the timeline and adjust its size. Make it look like a subscribe button that is a rectangle and place it at the bottom center of the background. You can put it anywhere you want it to appear in your future videos.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button4.png"                      alt="subscribe-button4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, let’s add Subscribe text into the button. Go to the Title and select any style that you like. “Basic 6” will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png"                      alt="subscribe-button5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with “Subscribe” and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png"                      alt="subscribe-button6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png"                      alt="subscribe-button7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png"                      alt="subscribe-button8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Now, it’s time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let’s animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the ‘Animation’ tab and then click ‘Customize.’ Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click ‘Add.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png"                      alt="subscribe-button9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%. It will make the rectangle pop up when you play the clip.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button10.png"                      alt="subscribe-button10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Text needs to be animated as well to match it with the rectangle. Double click on the text in the timeline and click ‘ADVANCED.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png"                      alt="subscribe-button11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> In this Advance text editor, go to the ‘Animation’ tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png"                      alt="subscribe-button12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking ‘Add’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png"                      alt="subscribe-button13"                ></p><p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png"                      alt="subscribe-button14"                ></p><p><strong>Step 15:</strong> To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png"                      alt="subscribe-button15"                ></p><p><strong>Step 16:</strong> You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora. Now place it into the timeline where it can match the movement of the cursor.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button16.png"                      alt="subscribe-button16"                ></p><p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now it’s time to make this subscribe animation button disappear. Move forward into the time to the end, at around 4 seconds. Double click on the red button in the timeline and add a key frame at its actual scale.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button17.png"                      alt="subscribe-button17"                ></p><p><strong>Step 18:</strong> After that, move further in the timeline to the end and make its scale 0. It will make it disappear.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button18.png"                      alt="subscribe-button18"                ></p><p><strong>Step 19:</strong> Do the same with the cursor. Double click on the cursor in the time and add a key frame at its actual position.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button19.png"                      alt="subscribe-button19"                ></p><p><strong>Step 20:</strong> Move ahead when you want it to disappear. Move the cursor out of the screen and click ‘OK’.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button20.png"                      alt="subscribe-button20"                ></p><p><strong>Step 21:</strong> Your Subscribe png gif is ready to be exported and used in your videos. Click on export and choose from various formats and options to choose from while exporting it.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button21.png"                      alt="subscribe-button21"                ></p><p>You may also like: <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>How to Get People to Subscribe Channel</strong></a></p><p>Conclusion：Your own Animated Subscribe Button is ready to be used in your future videos and projects.

Focus on the technical aspects of your YouTube video before you actually start shooting and strive to be well prepared for all the challenges a day on the set may bring.</p><p> These and other useful tips may help you make better videos for your YouTube channel, so let’s explore different ways of improving your video making skills.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos"></a>10 Tips for Shooting Better YouTube Videos</h2><p> All videographers agree that you shouldn’t come to the set unprepared. Everything has to be in its place, no matter how insignificant it may seem, because a tiny detail can completely ruin the shot or even an entire day of work. These tips are going to help you avoid common mistakes, inexperienced video producers often make.</p><h4 id="1-Write-the-Script"><a href="#1-Write-the-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Write the Script"></a>1. Write the Script</h4><p> Everything starts with a script, at least in the cinematography world. You don’t have to write long, detailed descriptions of all scenes, just make a short note of every scene, what is being said in the shot, on-screen actions, camera positions, and so on. By doing this, you’ll save yourself a lot of valuable time, you can then dedicate to other burning issues on the set. Besides, knowing what you are going to say throughout the video so you don’t have to improvise all the time is going to help you feel more relaxed in front of a camera.</p><h4 id="2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included"><a href="#2-Build-the-Set-Lighting-included" class="headerlink" title="2. Build the Set (Lighting included)"></a>2. Build the Set (Lighting included)</h4><p> Don’t leave anything to chance. You should control everything that is going to be in the shot, so avoid working at locations you can’t at least partially control. Shooting in studio-like conditions will enable you to carefully select the scenography and to design light so it matches the scene perfectly. The actors must always be clearly visible to the audience, which is why you need to pay attention to where they are located in the shot and how much light you have in that part of the shot.</p><h4 id="3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Batteries-Charged" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Batteries Charged"></a>3. Keep Your Batteries Charged</h4><p> There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at the set anxious to start shooting just to find out that the batteries are empty. Charge the batteries at the end of each day on the set, because the chances are that you are going to need them early in the morning. Always have several spare batteries with you, so even if one battery is empty you have the replacement ready. You can also prolong the battery life by switching the camera off when you are not recording.</p><h4 id="4-Do-a-Microphone-Check"><a href="#4-Do-a-Microphone-Check" class="headerlink" title="4. Do a Microphone Check"></a>4. Do a Microphone Check</h4><p> Capturing audio with an external microphone drastically increases the quality of the sound in your videos. That’s why making absolutely sure that all cables are connected and that the microphone is perfectly placed is paramount if you want to get the sound right. The host or the hosts of the video must be at the right distance from the microphone, usually, the length of their fist with the thumb and pinky finger extended, but this can vary a few inches to either side.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-microphone-for-youtuber-videos.html" >Check out the best microphone for YouTuber in 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition"><a href="#5-Pay-Attention-to-The-Shot-Composition" class="headerlink" title="5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition"></a>5. Pay Attention to The Shot Composition</h4><p> The rule of thirds is a common composition principle used by videographers to create balanced and unified images. The rule suggests that the subjects in a shot should be placed at the intersections of the lines that divide the screen. Most digital cameras have a grid that makes using the rule of thirds quite simple because you can easily see when the subjects in the shot are not positioned correctly.</p><p> This is just one of many shot composition techniques you have at your disposal, and as you gain more experience you’ll learn how to combine them and get aesthetically pleasing results.</p><h4 id="6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode"><a href="#6-Always-Record-Videos-in-Landscape-Mode" class="headerlink" title="6. Always Record Videos in Landscape Mode"></a>6. Always Record Videos in Landscape Mode</h4><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p> Posting vertically oriented videos to your YouTube channel will make you look unprofessional because portrait mode is never used for capturing videos. YouTubers who record their videos with Smartphones are more likely to fall into this trap, but all you need to do to avoid this is remember to hold the device horizontally.</p><p> By switching to portrait mode, you’ll be cropping the frame in a way, so you might unknowingly end up removing parts of the shot you wanted to record.</p><p> In case that you want to convert your portrait video to landscape, do not miss this article about <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/convert-portrait-video-to-landscape.html" >How to Convert A Portrait Video to Landscape. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises"><a href="#7-Eliminate-The-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="7. Eliminate The Background Noises"></a>7. Eliminate The Background Noises</h4><p> Professional microphones can pick up even the softest sounds, that might prove difficult to remove in the post-production. You can reduce the noise levels in your videos by using shotgun microphones that only capture sounds that come directly into the microphone, or by using the omnidirectional mic to eliminate the wind if you’re shooting on an outdoor location.</p><p> Background noises can be particularly unpleasant when recording narration, because the viewers of the video may not want to watch it until the end if they can’t hear what the person in the video is saying.</p><p> If it is hard for you to record your YouTube video in quite environment, you can <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/remove-background-noise-from-video.html" >remove the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by using some video editing software.

Keep The Shot in Focus"></a>8. Keep The Shot in Focus</h4><p> You can always keep the shot in focus by simply enabling the autofocus feature, but if you do so you won’t be able to control where the focus is going to be. Pulling focus manually is an art that takes years to master, and you have to keep practicing it as much as you can in order to become good at it.</p><p> The best way to deal with out of focus shots is to avoid shooting scenes that include a lot of action because you won’t have to pull focus that often.</p><h4 id="9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod"><a href="#9-Put-The-Camera-on-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="9.

All video cameras pick up vibrations easily, so even the slightest movement or impact can ruin a shot. Putting the camera on a tripod is one of the best ways to stabilize the shot and avoid camera shaking.</p><p> In addition, a tripod enables you to maintain image stability even when shooting form lower or upper angles, something that cannot be achieved by simply holding the camera.</p><p> We have chosen some of the <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/how-to-use-tripod-for-vlogging.html" >best tripods that you can use for starting a YouTube vlogging Video shooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Find The Best Angle"></a>10. Find The Best Angle</h4><p> Every scene has its perfect angle, you just have to find it. This job is much easier if you have already built the set and adjusted the lighting before approaching the shot selection process because it will allow you to know exactly where the camera should be.</p><p> The camera position depends on a number of factors, including the video’s aesthetics or the action that takes place in the shot, and you have to go through this process for each shot in your video.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Videos without Any Software Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Hopefully, the tips we provided in this article are going to help you create better YouTube videos.

Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.</p><p>Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg"                      alt="youtube platform"                ></p><p>Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos</h2><p>YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube aspect ratio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar’s white or grey&#x2F;black area along the edges.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop&#x2F;PC Version:</p><p>If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:</p><p>There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version</p><p>Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg"                      alt="vertical video example"                ></p><p>Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio</h2><p>The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube shorts ratio"                ></p><p>Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.</p><p>Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads"><a href="#Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads"></a>Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads</h2><p>If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income.

Those options are also available when you’re adding shapes, likes stars and sparkles.</p><p>Funimate is not built for typical editing, which is both its strength and its weakness. Trimming your clips is its own stage which you must complete before you start adding effects, and you cannot split clips or add multiple clips.</p><p>The free version of Funimate does add a small watermark to your videos in the bottom-right corner, but it is subtle enough that I almost missed it completely while reviewing the app.</p><h2 id="iMovie-iOS"><a href="#iMovie-iOS" class="headerlink" title="iMovie (iOS)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-ios.jpg"                      alt="iMovie"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Trailer templates</li><li>Themes</li><li>Limited tools and resources</li></ol><p>iMovie’s mobile app is designed for ease and includes things like ‘trailer templates’ and themes that allow you to make a video quickly and with minimal effort.</p><p>This streamlined app is limited in its features.

I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s difficult to use – it isn’t, it’s much easier than a lot of desktop software – but among mobile apps designed for streamlined efficiency it does stand out as being a bit harder to dive into.</p><p>That is partly because there’s a lot you can do with it. It has the tools you would expect in an editor.

So are adjustments to the length or crop of clips.</p><p>After you save your video you’ll have the option of creating a thumbnail using a screenshot from your video.

The idea is simple: shoot a video with a single colored backdrop (blue or green is often used), and then replace the background with any other video clip, graphic or still image you want. It’s highly effective and can be used for different topics and subjects. If you don’t know what a green screen is and how it works, check out the video tutorial below to get an overall idea first:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>In fact, nowadays, green screen is actually well within the capabilities and budget of people like you and I. Just shoot your video anywhere, and then replace the background with any stock photo, branded graphic or fantastic video clips. Want to try it out? You’d better get your own green screen ideas first.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="2.

The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content.

Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p><p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p><p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com.

Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s.

Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p><h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1.

Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="1.

For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3.

Then again, you’ll never know.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1.

On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.
