<p>There is a lot to learn about YouTube success from Jake Paul. With more than 300 hours of video uploaded onto YouTube every minute by more than ten million content creators, standing out from the competition and becoming a YouTube star can seem impossible. But, Jake Paul managed to achieve that in a short amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul"><a href="#How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="How Old Is Jake Paul?"></a>How Old Is Jake Paul?</h3><p>Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.</p>
<h3 id="Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul"><a href="#Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="Logan Paul and Jake Paul"></a>Logan Paul and Jake Paul</h3><p>He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p>
<p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p>
<p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p>
<p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p>

<p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p>
<p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p>
<h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel’s comedy series “Bizaardvark” and successfully landed the role of “Dirk.” However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake’s growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.</p>

<h3 id="Team-10"><a href="#Team-10" class="headerlink" title="Team 10"></a>Team 10</h3><p>In 2016, with all of his many exciting experiences, Jake put together a humorous and motivational memoir titled “You Gotta Want It.” As his own social media channels kept on growing rapidly, Jake launched “<strong>Team 10</strong>,” his own influencer management agency comprised of other teen social media influencers. In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.</p>
<p>More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p>

<p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p>
<p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p>
<p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p>

<p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.</p>

<p>Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience’s attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel’s analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content</strong></p>
<p>Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content. Jake moved into a house full of other teenagers also committed to content creation, and they all filmed themselves doing pranks and stunts every day.</p>

<p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p>
<p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p>
<p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p>

<p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.</p>

<p>Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience’s attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel’s analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content</strong></p>
<p>Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content. Jake moved into a house full of other teenagers also committed to content creation, and they all filmed themselves doing pranks and stunts every day.</p>

<p>There is a lot to learn about YouTube success from Jake Paul. With more than 300 hours of video uploaded onto YouTube every minute by more than ten million content creators, standing out from the competition and becoming a YouTube star can seem impossible. But, Jake Paul managed to achieve that in a short amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul-2"><a href="#How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul-2" class="headerlink" title="How Old Is Jake Paul?"></a>How Old Is Jake Paul?</h3><p>Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.</p>
<h3 id="Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul-2"><a href="#Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul-2" class="headerlink" title="Logan Paul and Jake Paul"></a>Logan Paul and Jake Paul</h3><p>He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p>
<p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p>
<p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p>
<p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p>

<p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p>
<p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p>
<h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney-2"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney-2" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel’s comedy series “Bizaardvark” and successfully landed the role of “Dirk.” However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake’s growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.</p>

In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.</p>
<p>More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p>

<p>Parody culture:</p>
<p>Musically Parody culture is defined as the humorous music, has melodic spoof as a rule of diverting. It has ironical expressions that give the song its speciality. These songs are different when it comes to different singers or different artists. This is because every artist has their style and speciality which they include while composing their Parody songs. It can even be in the form of general style music.</p>
<p>Parody culture was first recognized in the 14th century and it has been named as one of the most artistically expressed devices.</p>
<p>There are various types of Parodies’,</p>
<ul>
<li>Film Parody</li>
<li>Poetic Parody</li>
<li>Self- Parody</li>
</ul>
<p>Parody is more frequently used when it comes to political announcements in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Parody is in no way, shape or form fundamentally ironical, and may some of the time be finished with deference and energy about the subject in question, without being a remiss snide assault.</p>
<p>It is also used as a communicative dialogue bridge between cultures or at times subcultures.</p>
<p>Each endeavor at a Parody isn’t made similarly as a satire, and in each occurrence, the specific farce would need to experience the four-factor reasonable use examination to decide if it establishes a reasonable use.</p>
<p>In later occasions, the term melodic parody came to connote the hilarious utilization of new messages to previous vocal pieces, just as both genuine and amusing references to specific melodic styles</p>
<p> <strong>Top 10 Parody Songs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amish paradise</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al” Yankovic has his style when it comes to composing Parody songs. He raps the everyday difficulties faced by people in a Humorous way. The thing which most caught my eye was the fact that the surroundings were made simple but the song has its way of making one crack up with laughter. Having around 4 decades of experience in Music Yankovic was one of the most famous composers of his time. People found it lucky to have their songs Parodied down by him.</p>
<ul>
<li>I gotta feeling- College Humour:</li>
</ul>
<p>Back in the days, this was one of the most popular Parody. It got a few dazzling feedbacks which made teenagers go crazy on the song. Its lyrics define how the frat parties at colleges end up with hangovers and some hazy memories of them logging out from the world. With his cell phones and a very few clues how a drunk guy figures out what happened the night of the party is what the whole song is about.</p>
<ul>
<li>White and Nerdy:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song. It revolves around the lines that a Man ‘can’t roll with the gangsters’ because he is too ‘White and Nerdy’.</p>
<p>This refers to all the Nerds out there who are more concerned about computer programs, Video games, Comics, Fancy dresses like superman or watching the Stars wars movies hundreds of times. This is one of the biggest hits of the century and was considered to be one of the funniest songs ever made.</p>
<ul>
<li>She was beautiful, I swear:</li>
</ul>
<p>The Parody by Kevin sage revolves around the topic that he sees a girl on a subway but how she turned out to be a man. It starts by him swearing that he thought she was a girl, but as you all guessed reality was something much more hilariously colourful. He was too drunk to differentiate between a man and a woman. But well, it is too late to face the truth, isn’t it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at this Instagram- College Humour:</li>
</ul>
<p>It revolves around how the social App Instagram is used. It is used to make other people jealous of how awesome your life. At least that is how Nickelback portrays it to be. The way her picture is so cute or the food she ate is delicious. The fact that her vacation at the beach was magnificent or the dress she bought was beautiful is how the whole song is written to be. Instagram users are made fun of in a harmless way about how they seem obsessed with their puppies or kittens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tacky:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic describes the song about how tacky he is, or how he seems to eat food out of Instagram (Ironically of course). He talks about how he wears his sandals with socks or how he wears his belt with suspenders. It is a weirdly satisfying song.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song describes how fat a man is. He used Michael Jacksons song to make a Parody and this wasn’t the first time he did that. This video won the Grammy award for being the Best Concept Music Video ever. The video starts with a fat man walking and singing out all the problems he faces because of being fat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Telephone:</li>
</ul>
<p>A very famous and brilliant song. The video starts with the dialogue, “Will you tell me the concept of this telephone video or not’. This revolves around Lady Gaga. Maybe her weird costumes or her quirkiness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gangnam style:</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s face it, it is the most popular Parody which almost every citizen from the whole world had heard. Bark Baker has around 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube just because of this song. The most hilarious and also musically sound video which took over the entire industry with its massive hit.</p>
<ul>
<li>A complicated song:</li>
</ul>
<p>Another, massive hit by the famous “Weird Al,” Yankovic. This music video is divided into three parts. Each of them describing one of the weirdest situations the composer finds himself in. One revolves around too much pizza, the second one around the girl he loved but the fact that she was going to propose his cousin and the third one is about he almost knocked off this head while standing on a roller coaster ride.</p>
<p> Other famous Parody songs,</p>
<ul>
<li>Somebody that I used to know</li>
<li>Lose yourself</li>
<li>A lot</li>
<li>Friday</li>
<li>Poker face</li>
<li>Call me maybe</li>
<li>Hello</li>
<li>Beat it</li>
<li>Hooked on polkas</li>
<li>Boom Boom Pow</li>
<li>Party in the U.S.A</li>
<li>She’s always a woman</li>
<li>Best song ever</li>
<li>New rules</li>
<li>I’m a believer</li>
<li>All about that Bass</li>
<li>Tic Tok</li>
<li>Humble</li>
<li>I want a new Duck</li>
<li>Rehab</li>
<li>Blurred lines</li>
<li>Can’t feel my face</li>
</ul>
<p> Basics on how to make a Parody video:</p>
<p> Tips,</p>
<ul>
<li>Outline the structure of the song you want to write</li>
</ul>
<p>It is essential to pen down your ideas and structure it first instead of directly jumping to the finale. It can be done by putting down your primary theme at the top of the page and then penning the sub-themes. Try to simplify the meaning. Make note of all the important stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try matching all the syllables</li>
</ul>
<p>Match the syllables of the Parody with the lyrics of the original composition. This is what gives the song its flavour. Start by counting the number of syllables in both the versions and try matching them as much as you can to give the same feel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be active</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t be lazy. Think and rethink all your ideas. Start looking for inspiration around you. Keep your mind active at all times. Who knows, something might strike you when you least expect it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Thesaurus tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Make use of the internet and the tools it provides to beautify your work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try speaking the words out loud</li>
</ul>
<p>Language can be confusing. Avoid that by speaking out loud before finalizing. This is found to be much more productive than just thinking about them in your mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit and re-edit it</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t ever submit the first draft. Edit it again and again and present the best version of it to the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refine the song at last</li>
</ul>
<p>Try talking about it with your family and ask them how it can be modified. Be open to suggestions and refine it as much as you can.</p>
<p> And voila, you have the best Parody music.</p>
<p> Conclusion:</p>
<p> A Parody is a work that is made by copying a current unique work to ridicule or remark on a part of the first. The most punctual realized spoof masses date from the late fourteenth century and the technique got basic in the fifteenth and sixteenth 100 of years. Parody, in music, initially the inventive adjusting of a few voice portions of a prior synthesis to frame another organization, as often as possible a mass; in present-day melodic use, spoof, as a rule, alludes to the comical impersonation of a genuine piece.</p>
<p>Spoofs can target VIPs, government officials, creators, a style or pattern, or some other intriguing subject.</p>
<p>Parody is significant because it permits us to condemn and address without being forceful or noxious. Or maybe, we use satire.</p>
<p>Few famous Parody singers, makers or Industries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ellen DeGeneres</li>
<li>Weird Al Yankovic</li>
<li>College Humour</li>
</ul>

<p> Basics on how to make a Parody video:</p>
<p> Tips,</p>
<ul>
<li>Outline the structure of the song you want to write</li>
</ul>
<p>It is essential to pen down your ideas and structure it first instead of directly jumping to the finale. It can be done by putting down your primary theme at the top of the page and then penning the sub-themes. Try to simplify the meaning. Make note of all the important stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try matching all the syllables</li>
</ul>
<p>Match the syllables of the Parody with the lyrics of the original composition. This is what gives the song its flavour. Start by counting the number of syllables in both the versions and try matching them as much as you can to give the same feel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be active</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t be lazy. Think and rethink all your ideas. Start looking for inspiration around you. Keep your mind active at all times. Who knows, something might strike you when you least expect it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Thesaurus tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Make use of the internet and the tools it provides to beautify your work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try speaking the words out loud</li>
</ul>
<p>Language can be confusing. Avoid that by speaking out loud before finalizing. This is found to be much more productive than just thinking about them in your mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit and re-edit it</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t ever submit the first draft. Edit it again and again and present the best version of it to the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refine the song at last</li>
</ul>
<p>Try talking about it with your family and ask them how it can be modified. Be open to suggestions and refine it as much as you can.</p>
<p> And voila, you have the best Parody music.</p>
<p> Conclusion:</p>
<p> A Parody is a work that is made by copying a current unique work to ridicule or remark on a part of the first. The most punctual realized spoof masses date from the late fourteenth century and the technique got basic in the fifteenth and sixteenth 100 of years. Parody, in music, initially the inventive adjusting of a few voice portions of a prior synthesis to frame another organization, as often as possible a mass; in present-day melodic use, spoof, as a rule, alludes to the comical impersonation of a genuine piece.</p>
<p>Spoofs can target VIPs, government officials, creators, a style or pattern, or some other intriguing subject.</p>
<p>Parody is significant because it permits us to condemn and address without being forceful or noxious. Or maybe, we use satire.</p>
<p>Few famous Parody singers, makers or Industries:</p>

<li>Ellen DeGeneres</li>
<li>Weird Al Yankovic</li>

<p>Parody culture:</p>
<p>Musically Parody culture is defined as the humorous music, has melodic spoof as a rule of diverting. It has ironical expressions that give the song its speciality. These songs are different when it comes to different singers or different artists. This is because every artist has their style and speciality which they include while composing their Parody songs. It can even be in the form of general style music.</p>
<p>Parody culture was first recognized in the 14th century and it has been named as one of the most artistically expressed devices.</p>
<p>There are various types of Parodies’,</p>
<ul>
<li>Film Parody</li>
<li>Poetic Parody</li>
<li>Self- Parody</li>
</ul>
<p>Parody is more frequently used when it comes to political announcements in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Parody is in no way, shape or form fundamentally ironical, and may some of the time be finished with deference and energy about the subject in question, without being a remiss snide assault.</p>
<p>It is also used as a communicative dialogue bridge between cultures or at times subcultures.</p>
<p>Each endeavor at a Parody isn’t made similarly as a satire, and in each occurrence, the specific farce would need to experience the four-factor reasonable use examination to decide if it establishes a reasonable use.</p>
<p>In later occasions, the term melodic parody came to connote the hilarious utilization of new messages to previous vocal pieces, just as both genuine and amusing references to specific melodic styles</p>
<p> <strong>Top 10 Parody Songs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amish paradise</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al” Yankovic has his style when it comes to composing Parody songs. He raps the everyday difficulties faced by people in a Humorous way. The thing which most caught my eye was the fact that the surroundings were made simple but the song has its way of making one crack up with laughter. Having around 4 decades of experience in Music Yankovic was one of the most famous composers of his time. People found it lucky to have their songs Parodied down by him.</p>
<ul>
<li>I gotta feeling- College Humour:</li>
</ul>
<p>Back in the days, this was one of the most popular Parody. It got a few dazzling feedbacks which made teenagers go crazy on the song. Its lyrics define how the frat parties at colleges end up with hangovers and some hazy memories of them logging out from the world. With his cell phones and a very few clues how a drunk guy figures out what happened the night of the party is what the whole song is about.</p>
<ul>
<li>White and Nerdy:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song. It revolves around the lines that a Man ‘can’t roll with the gangsters’ because he is too ‘White and Nerdy’.</p>
<p>This refers to all the Nerds out there who are more concerned about computer programs, Video games, Comics, Fancy dresses like superman or watching the Stars wars movies hundreds of times. This is one of the biggest hits of the century and was considered to be one of the funniest songs ever made.</p>
<ul>
<li>She was beautiful, I swear:</li>
</ul>
<p>The Parody by Kevin sage revolves around the topic that he sees a girl on a subway but how she turned out to be a man. It starts by him swearing that he thought she was a girl, but as you all guessed reality was something much more hilariously colourful. He was too drunk to differentiate between a man and a woman. But well, it is too late to face the truth, isn’t it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at this Instagram- College Humour:</li>
</ul>
<p>It revolves around how the social App Instagram is used. It is used to make other people jealous of how awesome your life. At least that is how Nickelback portrays it to be. The way her picture is so cute or the food she ate is delicious. The fact that her vacation at the beach was magnificent or the dress she bought was beautiful is how the whole song is written to be. Instagram users are made fun of in a harmless way about how they seem obsessed with their puppies or kittens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tacky:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic describes the song about how tacky he is, or how he seems to eat food out of Instagram (Ironically of course). He talks about how he wears his sandals with socks or how he wears his belt with suspenders. It is a weirdly satisfying song.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song describes how fat a man is. He used Michael Jacksons song to make a Parody and this wasn’t the first time he did that. This video won the Grammy award for being the Best Concept Music Video ever. The video starts with a fat man walking and singing out all the problems he faces because of being fat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Telephone:</li>
</ul>
<p>A very famous and brilliant song. The video starts with the dialogue, “Will you tell me the concept of this telephone video or not’. This revolves around Lady Gaga. Maybe her weird costumes or her quirkiness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gangnam style:</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s face it, it is the most popular Parody which almost every citizen from the whole world had heard. Bark Baker has around 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube just because of this song. The most hilarious and also musically sound video which took over the entire industry with its massive hit.</p>
<ul>
<li>A complicated song:</li>
</ul>
<p>Another, massive hit by the famous “Weird Al,” Yankovic. This music video is divided into three parts. Each of them describing one of the weirdest situations the composer finds himself in. One revolves around too much pizza, the second one around the girl he loved but the fact that she was going to propose his cousin and the third one is about he almost knocked off this head while standing on a roller coaster ride.</p>
<p> Other famous Parody songs,</p>
<ul>

<li>Lose yourself</li>
<li>A lot</li>
