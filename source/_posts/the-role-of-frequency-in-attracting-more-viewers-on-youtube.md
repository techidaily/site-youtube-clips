How often should you upload to YouTube?

Scheduling isn’t the most glamourous part of being a YouTube creator, but it is important. Having a schedule and sticking to it is one of the best ways to [grow your subscriber base](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [keep your existing subscribers engaged](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and keep yourself from drifting away from YouTube.

Creative people don’t always like the idea of scheduling. You either feel inspired or you don’t (click here to [learn how to come up with video ideas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). If that means you go a month without posting and then post 3 times in one week, what’s the harm in that?

The harm is that your channel will grow more slowly, you won’t get as many views on the videos when you post them, and if you do manage to bring in new subscribers they might forget about you by the next time you’re feeling inspired. [Making great content](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you really care about is essential to being successful on YouTube, but it isn’t the only important thing.

_Sticking to a schedule is one of Phil's most important tips for getting subs!_

Here are 5 tips on how you can make a schedule for yourself and actually stick to it. Read to the end to find out which are the best days to post to YouTube!

## 1\. Be Specific About Your YouTube Posting Schedule

Don’t just say you’re going to post a new video every week, decide on a specific day and time. If your subscribers expect new posts from you Thursdays at 4 pm, they will check your channel for those new posts every Thursday at 4 pm. This will make it easier for you to keep your view count close to your subscriber count.

The other benefit of being specific about your posting time is that the more specific you are, the less wiggle room you give yourself. Setting a clear deadline with yourself makes it harder to procrastinate.

## 2\. Make Your YouTube Upload Schedule Public

Post your schedule somewhere potential subscribers can see it like in your channel banner, intro, or video descriptions. The reason schedules work as a tool for growth is that they allow your audience to build up anticipation. It will be easier for newcomers to your channel to feel that anticipation if you start setting expectations for them on their first visit.

Committing publicly to a posting schedule means making a promise to your viewers. If you break that promise, they will be disappointed. This social pressure should help to keep you posting consistently.

## 3\. Remember That Posting on YouTube Takes Time

When you decide what day you want to post on, make sure that it’s a day where you have a lot of time to spend on things like writing your description, promoting your video, and answering comments.

It might be helpful to set a private deadline for yourself the day before your official post to upload your video and enter all of your metadata (title, description, tags). Then you can keep the video private until it’s time to post.

## 4\. Bank YouTube Videos

It might happen that one week you’re full of ideas and energy and making videos is a breeze. It can be tempting to abandon your schedule and post more than normal, but you should resist that urge. Don’t waste all that energy – make the videos – but instead of posting them all right away, you should save them for weeks where you aren’t feeling the same enthusiasm.

## 5\. Set Realistic Goals

Your schedule shouldn’t leave you feeling burnt out. When you’re coming up with your schedule, think realistically about how much time you have to devote to YouTube and how much time you need to spend on a video. Give yourself enough time that you can keep to your schedule without feeling rushed.

Never make your schedule based on what other YouTubers are doing. Your lives are different.

Posting once a week is a good standard schedule, but if you like to spend a lot of time editing your videos and you work full time then maybe once a week isn’t realistic for you. Maybe you should post once every two weeks.

## The Best Days and Times to Post to YouTube

The best times to post are **Thursdays** and **Fridays** between 12 and 3pm (in the time zone of the majority of your subscribers – just check analytics in your Creator Studio). These are the times when there are the most viewers available to watch your videos. Monday and Tuesday are the worst days to post.

_Amy's scheduling advice: don't bite off more than you can chew!_

So, how many times do you upload per week, or per month? How often should you upload to YouTube?
