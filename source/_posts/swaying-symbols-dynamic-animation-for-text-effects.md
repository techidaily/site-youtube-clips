Earlier, you learned how to have a **[bounce text effect in Adobe After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. However, because AE is a complex application and has a steep learning curve, this section explains the two alternative ways to get the same effect on your existing video footage.

## Method 1: How to Create Bouncing Text in Filmora Video Editor?

When talking about [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the application is populated with several presets for texts and titles, animations, effects, filters, and much more.

These pre-built templates not only make your task easier, they also save your decent amount of time that you would spend while working with After Effects or any other similar app that requires you to build things from scratch.

You can follow the instructions given below to **add animated bounce text** to any of your video footages with Filmora:

#### Step 1: Add a Footage to Timeline

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC. By default, the [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of the project is set to 16:9\. Click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left section, and select and import footage you want to add bounce text to.

#### Step 2: Insert Text and Add Bounce Effect

Click **Titles** from the standard toolbar at the top, and click and drag your preferred title template from the Library to the timeline. In case you don’t want any specific animation or style on the title, you can use the default title.

In the timeline, double-click the title you just added, use the upper-left section to edit the text, go to the **Animation** tab from the left pane, scroll down the list, and double-click the **Up Down 1** or **Up Down 2** preset to apply the bounce effect to the credits. Click **OK** to save the changes and to get back to the main window.

**Step 3: Add Shake Filters**

Go to **Effects** from the standard toolbar, expand the **Filters** category from the left pane, and click **Shake**. From the Library window, click and drag your preferred shake filter to the timeline. Here, I will choose Mild.

![Shake filters in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shake-filter.jpg)

You can customize the default effect by double-clicking the shake filter in the timeline, using the sliders in the upper-left area of the interface to make necessary adjustments, and then clicking **OK** to save the changes and to get back to the previous interface.

![Mild Shake filters adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mild-shake-filter-adjust.jpg)

**Step 4: Export the Final Output**

Click **EXPORT** from the top of the interface, go to the **Local** tab in the **Export** box, choose your preferred output format from the list in the left, make required customizations from the right pane, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Filmora9 Export Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-filmora9-video.jpg)

Now, you can add the bouncing text video and the background video to the timeline, and then place the bouncing text video above the background video track.

Double click the text track, go to the **Chroma Key** effect, select the **Color Picker** tool, and click anywhere in the Preview window to get things right. Finally, export the entire project to your preferred output format as explained in **Step 4**.

As explained before, Wondeshare Filmora makes the entire process of creating and adding **bounce text** effect pretty simple. With all the pre-build templates, and the versatility of the options that can be used to customize those presets, you can come up with the effects that are usually obtained when you start generating them from the scratch.

## Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online

If you don’t want any heavy and resource-intensive app on your PC merely for some special text effects, you can try any of the online solutions instead. The benefit of using any such web app is that all the processing is done on site’s server, and it is only a web browser and an Internet connection that you need to have at your side.

Some most trusted websites to generate **bounce text** are listed below:

#### 1\. ENGFTO

Also, use the fields under the **BACKGROUND** section to either change the background color, or pick a background image from your PC.

**Step 3: Obtain the Animated Text**

Click the **SAVE GIF ANIMATION** button from the lower section of the page to download the animated text to your PC.

![Create Animated Bouncing Text with Loading.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bouncing-text-with-loadingio.jpg)

Use the options available on the webpage to type your text, and change its font, color, background, transparency level etc. Select **Bounce** (or any of its variants) from the **Animation** drop-down list, and adjust the speed using the **Speed** slider.

**Step 3: Obtain the Text**

**Conclusion**

Generating **bounce text** effect is much simpler when you use Wondershare Filmora or any of the online solutions as explained in Method 2\. While the former gives you more flexibility when it comes to customizations, the latter doesn’t require any app to be installed on your PC. In addition, many times the web apps offer their services for free, and therefore they are preferred by the novice users who are not much into post-production processes.

Earlier, you learned how to have a **[bounce text effect in Adobe After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. However, because AE is a complex application and has a steep learning curve, this section explains the two alternative ways to get the same effect on your existing video footage.

## Method 1: How to Create Bouncing Text in Filmora Video Editor?

When talking about [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the application is populated with several presets for texts and titles, animations, effects, filters, and much more.

These pre-built templates not only make your task easier, they also save your decent amount of time that you would spend while working with After Effects or any other similar app that requires you to build things from scratch.

You can follow the instructions given below to **add animated bounce text** to any of your video footages with Filmora:

#### Step 1: Add a Footage to Timeline

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC. By default, the [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of the project is set to 16:9\. Click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left section, and select and import footage you want to add bounce text to.

#### Step 2: Insert Text and Add Bounce Effect

Click **Titles** from the standard toolbar at the top, and click and drag your preferred title template from the Library to the timeline. In case you don’t want any specific animation or style on the title, you can use the default title.

In the timeline, double-click the title you just added, use the upper-left section to edit the text, go to the **Animation** tab from the left pane, scroll down the list, and double-click the **Up Down 1** or **Up Down 2** preset to apply the bounce effect to the credits. Click **OK** to save the changes and to get back to the main window.

**Step 3: Add Shake Filters**

Go to **Effects** from the standard toolbar, expand the **Filters** category from the left pane, and click **Shake**. From the Library window, click and drag your preferred shake filter to the timeline. Here, I will choose Mild.

![Shake filters in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shake-filter.jpg)

You can customize the default effect by double-clicking the shake filter in the timeline, using the sliders in the upper-left area of the interface to make necessary adjustments, and then clicking **OK** to save the changes and to get back to the previous interface.

**Step 4: Export the Final Output**

![Filmora9 Export Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-filmora9-video.jpg)

Now, you can add the bouncing text video and the background video to the timeline, and then place the bouncing text video above the background video track.

Double click the text track, go to the **Chroma Key** effect, select the **Color Picker** tool, and click anywhere in the Preview window to get things right. Finally, export the entire project to your preferred output format as explained in **Step 4**.

As explained before, Wondeshare Filmora makes the entire process of creating and adding **bounce text** effect pretty simple. With all the pre-build templates, and the versatility of the options that can be used to customize those presets, you can come up with the effects that are usually obtained when you start generating them from the scratch.
