## Basic Information of YouTube Mix

Before starting, let's learn some basic information about the YouTube Music Mix playlists:

### Three Ways Of YouTube Music Mix

YouTube has popularized three personalized mixes to keep you up-to-date on newly released music and introduce more artists to you:

**Discover Mix:** Discover Mix introduces you to 50 new tracks every week, expanding your musical horizons and introducing you to contemporary artists. This playlist mix provides new updates every Wednesday, making it a go-to playlist for discovering new music to your taste.

![discover mix on youtube music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/discover-mix-on-youtube-music.png)

**New Release Mix:** In the New Release Mix playlist, you can find all the newest tracks from your favorite artists, and some music is recommended. New updates are provided every Friday (when most new releases come out), and mid-week releases the entire week to ensure you're always up-to-date on the latest music.

### 3\. How Do I Add Songs To The Replay Mix Playlist?

You can't manually add songs to the Replay Mix because YouTube Music automatically adds tracks that you listen to more than once.

The more often you hear a soundtrack, the higher it will appear on the YouTube list. Conversely, songs you've only played once or twice will appear lower on the list.
