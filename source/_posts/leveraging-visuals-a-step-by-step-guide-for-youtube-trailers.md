## Why Should You Use Youtube as a News Source?

According to a recent Pew Research Center research, YouTube channels are an important source of news and information for more than a quarter of all individuals in the United States. While that's a lot of people turning to YouTube for news, it's not surprising given that the platform is the world's second most-trafficked search engine, directly behind its sister business Google. People use YouTube as a source of information, but they're seeking video rather than text.

#### What Are the Benefits of Youtube News?

What's more surprising is that conventional news media organizations don't account for nearly as much of what consumers consume. According to the report, half of the individuals who get their news via YouTube watch independent channels. And, of those who use YouTube to keep up with current events, 72 percent believe the platform is either an important or the most significant source of information for them. Independent media on YouTube frequently covers situations and topics that the mainstream media may overlook. It's also often complementing, allowing viewers to understand the concerns better.

## Why Should You Use Youtube as a News Source?

Many people use YouTube to watch funny viral videos and make-up lessons. However, a sizable portion of the American population relies on YouTube for news.

According to a recent Pew Research Center research, YouTube channels are an important source of news and information for more than a quarter of all individuals in the United States. While that's a lot of people turning to YouTube for news, it's not surprising given that the platform is the world's second most-trafficked search engine, directly behind its sister business Google. People use YouTube as a source of information, but they're seeking video rather than text.

#### What Are the Benefits of Youtube News?

What's more surprising is that conventional news media organizations don't account for nearly as much of what consumers consume. According to the report, half of the individuals who get their news via YouTube watch independent channels. And, of those who use YouTube to keep up with current events, 72 percent believe the platform is either an important or the most significant source of information for them. Independent media on YouTube frequently covers situations and topics that the mainstream media may overlook. It's also often complementing, allowing viewers to understand the concerns better.
