#### 3. Taha Chimar

Those who do not have PhotoShop can use Taha Chimar’s end screen designs that come in png file format.

To download, you will have to follow a URL link in the description box of the YouTube videos. Be careful, though, as a lot of the links lead to free hosting websites with pop-ups that can harm your computer if you are easily fooled by them.

#### 4. SoapyEdits

Another way to get your YouTube end screens for free, of course, is to make them yourself. Canva is a great free online design tool for this.

## Part 2: How To Build Your Outro For Free (Step-by-step Canva Tutorial)

1\. First, you have to sign up with an e-mail address

![create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1.jpg)

2\. Once logged in, select “use custom dimensions” and plug in “1920” pixels as your width and “1080” pixels as your height (this, of course, may vary depending on the resolution of your video project).

3\. After clicking “Design!,” a new browser will open with a blank canvas.

4\. Next, do an image search for “YouTube End Screen,” choose an end screen with a layout that you would like to build off of, and save the image onto your computer.

![stretch-end-screen-templates-canva ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stretch-end-screen-templates-canva.jpg)

7\. Insert your own shapes, lines, colours, images, and text over the image.

![adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva.jpg)
