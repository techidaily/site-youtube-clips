![adjust ai portrait effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-6.jpg)

Step3 You can add royalty-free music to your YouTube video by clicking Audio from the top. Then, select the preferred audio to use in the video and move it to the timeline.

![add royalty-free music to your youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-7.jpg)

To adjust your audio settings, double-click the audio clip from the timeline and use the relevant button to balance audio fade-in and fade-out, volume, pitch, etc.

![double-click the audio clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-8.jpg)

Step4 Another crucial thing you need to do is to add Subscribe watermark. To do this, click the >> icon next to Export from the top of the screen and select Element.

![click element filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-9.jpg)

Locate and click ‘Social Media Show Element 07’ Effects. Drag-n-drop the selected effect to the Timeline.

![add subscribe watermark filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-10.jpg)

Step5 Change the position where the Subscribe watermark should appear in your video. Then, play the video to preview it.

Step6 After you’re done with the editing, click the Export button from the top bar and choose Burn DVD from the drop-down list that shows up.

![preview edited video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-11.jpg)

End screens work on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets. This was not the case for annotations (YouTube’s former way of doing these things). As more YouTubers have jumped onto using end screens, the need for well-designed end screen templates have rapidly grown. In this post, I will

#### 2. Grabster

Grabster offers five free YouTube end screen templates. With each download, you’ll get a PhotoShop PSD file and a font file so that you can change the text.

#### 3. Taha Chimar

Those who do not have PhotoShop can use Taha Chimar’s end screen designs that come in png file format.

![taha-chimar-youtube-end-screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/taha-chimar-youtube-end-screen.jpg)

To download, you will have to follow a URL link in the description box of the YouTube videos. Be careful, though, as a lot of the links lead to free hosting websites with pop-ups that can harm your computer if you are easily fooled by them.

#### 4. SoapyEdits

SoapyEdits is a YouTuber with a [channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-0Oq4zZj8hJkW1aXFzLr-x6WsjuGsW1) offering a whole playlist of PhotoShop PSD file end screen designs.

Here are some of our favorite ones.

Here’s one for the Minecraft fans:

Another way to get your YouTube end screens for free, of course, is to make them yourself. Canva is a great free online design tool for this.

## Part 2: How To Build Your Outro For Free (Step-by-step Canva Tutorial)

1\. First, you have to sign up with an e-mail address

![create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1.jpg)

2\. Once logged in, select “use custom dimensions” and plug in “1920” pixels as your width and “1080” pixels as your height (this, of course, may vary depending on the resolution of your video project).

![create-outro-end-screen-with-canva  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-2.jpg)

3\. After clicking “Design!,” a new browser will open with a blank canvas.

4\. Next, do an image search for “YouTube End Screen,” choose an end screen with a layout that you would like to build off of, and save the image onto your computer.

![download-youtube-outro-end-screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-outro-end-screen.jpg)

5\. Upload the image onto your Canva project.

![upload-downloaded-youtube-end-screen-canva ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-downloaded-youtube-end-screen-canva.jpg)

6\. Stretch your image to the ends of your canvas.

![stretch-end-screen-templates-canva ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stretch-end-screen-templates-canva.jpg)

7\. Insert your own shapes, lines, colours, images, and text over the image.

![adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva.jpg)

8\. When you’re done, delete the original image so that you’re left with just your own design. Go ahead and click “download.”
