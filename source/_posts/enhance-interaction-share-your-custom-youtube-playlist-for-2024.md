## Enhance Interaction: Share Your Custom YouTube Playlist

YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.

But what if you've created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we've put together an extensive guide on **how to** **share a YouTube playlist** on your computer and mobile devices.

So, let's get started with our guide without any further delay!

## Why Doesn't The Share Function In The Playlist Work?

Firstly, let's figure out why the "Share" function doesn't work. The "Share" function in the playlist does not work because it is set to "private," and YouTube doesn't allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to "public" in the following way:

Step1 Head to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.

Step2

* **Click** the three-line **"Menu"** icon at the top-left of your screen.
* Go to **"Library."**
* Scroll down to the **"Playlist"** section.

Step3 Select your playlist labeled as **"Private."** On the next page, click the **"Private"** option in the playlist details section and select **"Public"** to change the visibility of your playlist.

Once the privacy setting has been changed, the **"share"** function will work as intended.
