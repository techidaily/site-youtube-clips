## Precision & Flair: Tailoring Background Imagery to Stand Out on Thumbnails

YouTube is a platform where you can make money from videos. But in order to earn, your videos should get lots of views. The thing is that YouTube is a competitive space. So many others are trying to do the same. Thus, you'll be competing for viewers' time and attention. How can you win that battle? One way is to add eye-catching YouTube thumbnail backgrounds.

The video thumbnail will leave an impression on viewers looking for something to watch. So ensuring it is high-quality is crucial. In this article, you'll learn where to find amazing thumbnail backgrounds and how to add them to your thumbnails.

![youtube thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background.gif)

## Why Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

When people are searching for something to watch on YouTube, they'll look at two (2) things:

1. They'll check the title to see how relevant it is to what they're looking for.
2. Two, they'll check the video thumbnail.

Thumbnail helps them determine off the bat if the video is high quality or not. A poor thumbnail will push them away, while a good one will encourage them to click.

That said, YouTubers should ensure their thumbnails are on point. Your thumbnails should be visually striking. One way to achieve that is by changing the thumbnail background. It allows you to remove unnecessary objects from the image. Additionally, it lets you improve the aesthetic of the thumbnail.

Now the question is: how do you change a YouTube thumbnail background?

Choosing the background image from [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is great because it saves you lots of time and resources.

## How To Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

Suppose you have downloaded a high-quality image that will work great as a thumbnail background for your YouTube video. What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.

Choosing the background image from [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora's native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube's suggested thumbnail size.

It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don't have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.

Filmora's tools for editing the video thumbnail aren't too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more. You can use Wondershare Filmora's AI Portrait feature to easily change it.
