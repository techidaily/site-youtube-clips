## **Part 3: Block content on YouTube kids**

 YouTube Kids is the alternative version of YouTube’s video service dedicated and designed for kids. It’s entirely for children with all the content curated for kids’ education, family-friendly videos, and channels surrounding kid’s liking. The interface features colorful large images, and icons with five categories to explore from.

 The app filters all the content allowing only safe content and parental control to watch their children’s online activity. The app prevents commenting and any kind of cyber bullying-related issues. YouTube Kids need to be set up by an adult with singing into the app with their Google credentials. Parents can sign in and block channels or videos they don’t see fit for their children. Let us see how to block YouTube channels on YouTube kids.

* 1\. Open the YouTube Kids app and tap on **I’m a parent** to set up the app.

## **Conclusion**

 Every minute more than 300 hours of video content is uploaded on to the YouTube databases while 5 billion videos are watched every day. This only shows the metrics a content creator and a user have to deal with. Content creators need to protect themselves from the unending trolls and scams that hit every other channel and affect its userbase. While kids and sensitive portions of the human population have to maintain a safe distance from damaging and provoking content that circulates on the platform. To safeguard both ends of the platform I made this guide to streamline the process of **how to block YouTube channels** and videos from affecting your happy life.

## **Conclusion**

 Every minute more than 300 hours of video content is uploaded on to the YouTube databases while 5 billion videos are watched every day. This only shows the metrics a content creator and a user have to deal with. Content creators need to protect themselves from the unending trolls and scams that hit every other channel and affect its userbase. While kids and sensitive portions of the human population have to maintain a safe distance from damaging and provoking content that circulates on the platform. To safeguard both ends of the platform I made this guide to streamline the process of **how to block YouTube channels** and videos from affecting your happy life.

## **Part 3: Block content on YouTube kids**

 YouTube Kids is the alternative version of YouTube’s video service dedicated and designed for kids. It’s entirely for children with all the content curated for kids’ education, family-friendly videos, and channels surrounding kid’s liking. The interface features colorful large images, and icons with five categories to explore from.

 The app filters all the content allowing only safe content and parental control to watch their children’s online activity. The app prevents commenting and any kind of cyber bullying-related issues. YouTube Kids need to be set up by an adult with singing into the app with their Google credentials. Parents can sign in and block channels or videos they don’t see fit for their children. Let us see how to block YouTube channels on YouTube kids.
