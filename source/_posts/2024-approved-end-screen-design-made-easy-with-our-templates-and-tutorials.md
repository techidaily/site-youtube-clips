#### 2. Grabster

Grabster offers five free YouTube end screen templates. With each download, you’ll get a PhotoShop PSD file and a font file so that you can change the text.

#### 3. Taha Chimar

![taha-chimar-youtube-end-screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/taha-chimar-youtube-end-screen.jpg)

To download, you will have to follow a URL link in the description box of the YouTube videos. Be careful, though, as a lot of the links lead to free hosting websites with pop-ups that can harm your computer if you are easily fooled by them.

## Part 2: How To Build Your Outro For Free (Step-by-step Canva Tutorial)

1\. First, you have to sign up with an e-mail address

![create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-1.jpg)

2\. Once logged in, select “use custom dimensions” and plug in “1920” pixels as your width and “1080” pixels as your height (this, of course, may vary depending on the resolution of your video project).

![create-outro-end-screen-with-canva  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-outro-end-screen-with-canva-2.jpg)

3\. After clicking “Design!,” a new browser will open with a blank canvas.

4\. Next, do an image search for “YouTube End Screen,” choose an end screen with a layout that you would like to build off of, and save the image onto your computer.

![download-youtube-outro-end-screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-outro-end-screen.jpg)

5\. Upload the image onto your Canva project.

![upload-downloaded-youtube-end-screen-canva ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-downloaded-youtube-end-screen-canva.jpg)

6\. Stretch your image to the ends of your canvas.

![stretch-end-screen-templates-canva ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stretch-end-screen-templates-canva.jpg)

7\. Insert your own shapes, lines, colours, images, and text over the image.

![adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-end-screen-templates-in-canva.jpg)

8\. When you’re done, delete the original image so that you’re left with just your own design. Go ahead and click “download.”

#### 3. Taha Chimar

Those who do not have PhotoShop can use Taha Chimar’s end screen designs that come in png file format.

![taha-chimar-youtube-end-screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/taha-chimar-youtube-end-screen.jpg)

To download, you will have to follow a URL link in the description box of the YouTube videos. Be careful, though, as a lot of the links lead to free hosting websites with pop-ups that can harm your computer if you are easily fooled by them.

#### 4. SoapyEdits

SoapyEdits is a YouTuber with a [channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-0Oq4zZj8hJkW1aXFzLr-x6WsjuGsW1) offering a whole playlist of PhotoShop PSD file end screen designs.

Here are some of our favorite ones.

Can you buy 1 million YouTube views? Won't YouTube ban your account?

Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.

Buying views isn’t necessarily against YouTube’s rules (it is against the spirit of the rules and can still get you in trouble), depending on how you do it (in general: buying real-people views is technically not against the rules and buying bot views is definitely against them). There are many companies that claim to sell high-quality views that can actually get you in trouble.

So, who can you trust?

## Best YouTube Video Editor- Wondershare Filmora

Do you want to make a creative YouTube video? Wondershare Filmora has some cool features like pan & zoom, add text & title, green screen, overlays & filters, background music & voice over, transitions, and effects that can make your YouTube video get into a pro mode. Just get started and try it!

## **How to Buy 1 Million YouTube Views**

Something to watch out for is if a service says you will reach 1 million views almost overnight. These sites either cannot really deliver on the time frame they promise or are not providing ‘real’ views. They may be using bots that generate a large number of fake views quickly, which can be dangerous for your channel.

What you want are high retention views from real humans. Quality services, like the ones listed below, will have real people watch your videos (or at least play them all the way through while they do other things). A good turnaround period for 1 million YouTube views is between 6 and 8 months. A waiting period of a few months is necessary if you want viewer retention.

Viewer retention means someone is actually watching your video, not just clicking on it and clicking away (which is bad for your search engine ranking). Beware that almost all view buying sites will claim to sell high retention views regardless of if they do or not.

Trustworthy services often have other services available, such as Social Promotion on other social media platforms or YouTube likes and comments. These will help to encourage more organic views, likes, and comments. Also, if your views go up but you have no likes or comments then that might tip people off that you’ve bought views and while it is not against the rules there is certainly a stigma attached.

It is worth mentioning that while buying human views is not technically against YouTube's rules and can be done safely, [buying subscribers is more dangerous](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## **Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views**

[BuyViewsReview](http://buyviewsreview.com/) is a site dedicated to helping you avoid scams that can hurt your channel. They test companies that sell views to make sure they can deliver on their promises safely. It really pays off to spend some time there and learn about the [view selling industry](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/don%E2%80%99t-get-scammed--buy-safe-youtube-views-from-top-providers-290.html) before you jump in and start spending money.

Here are BuyViewsReveiew’s top 3 trusted providers from whom you can buy 1 million YouTube views safely:

 **#1: Devumi:**

Devumi offers a 100% money-back guarantee, which should be a given for these kinds of services. They have a reasonable completion time of an average of 3 to 4 months for most orders, and you can stake advantage of the video SEO service for free. According to BuyViewsReview’s test, their customer service is excellent.

You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $3,497 on Devumi.

 **#2: BuyViews:**

BuyViews is another option when you're trying to reach 1 million views on YouTube. Offering a 100% money-back guarantee just like Devumi, BuyViews’ average time of completion is slightly lower. With this service, you can also buy likes and comments or take advantage of their social promotion options.

You can buy 1 million views for $4,000 on BuyViews, which is slightly more than Devumi’s price.

 **#3: FastFollowerz:**

FastFollowersz also offers a 100% money-back guarantee. They are able to deliver on their promises, but they are in the number 3 slot because they are not totally safe – 2/5 videos in BuyViewsReviews’ test of this service were taken down by YouTube. It also seems like the views they offer are low retention, which can hurt your channel even if your videos don’t get removed.

You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $2,800 on FastFollowerz, which is significantly less than the two higher-ranked options.
