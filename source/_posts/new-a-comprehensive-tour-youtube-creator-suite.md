The [YouTube Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an essential aspect of managing a successful channel (click here to learn more about the [Analytics section of your Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). Using the tools available in the Creator studio you can manage your videos, interact with your audience, and keep track of important video statistics.

The Creator Studio’s interface is customizable so you can add or remove widgets based on the tools that you most commonly use.

On the main dashboard of the Creator Studio, you will see a menu that includes your video manager, live streaming support, community page, channel page, analytics, translations, and transcriptions.

Also on the dashboard, you can see analytics for the most successful videos that you have posted.

## Adjusting the Dashboard

Pinning new charts to the dashboard will ensure that all of the data you need most often is easily viewable upon first entering the Creator Studio. All you need to do to add new widgets to the dashboard sidebar is to use the **add widget** feature.

Making adjustments to your current widgets simply involves clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner to add custom tiles as well as rearrange the order of the various widgets that you have selected.

## YouTube Creator Studio Tools

**Video Manager:** from the Video Manager section you can view any of the videos that you have posted to YouTube. This menu includes all of your uploaded videos whether they are public, unlisted, or private. You can see advanced statistics on every one of the videos you posted as well as download MP4s of your videos for re-editing. The video manager allows you to very quickly select multiple videos and then add them to a playlist.

**Live streaming**: YouTube has made it easy for anyone with a verified account to go live. There are even special monetization features specifically for live streaming. Streaming is especially vital to the gaming genre on YouTube.

**Analytics:** the analytic section is essential to your success as a video creator. Through analytics, you can see which of your videos are most successful in terms of watch time, views, or monetization and you can even check how many new subscribers individual videos are attracting to your channel. This information is important because once you know what’s working you can keep doing it and start growing your channel faster.

Other information you can access through your Creator Studio includes the demographics (nationality, gender, age) of your viewers, video comments, your subscriber list, and any information related to copyright strikes.

**Engage with your audience**  
This is a crucial part if you want to be a successful YouTuber. These top 10 creators have shown that engaging with their audience has a great impact on the outcome of their production.

**They have executed channel trailers**  
Another common similarity with these top 10 YouTubers is the use of channel trailers features. You get short trailers that automatically play when a viewer lands on the YouTube channel page. These should, however, be short and give viewers a welcoming feeling to stay along.

A well-made video is all you need to make an impact on your YouTube channel journey.

* It automatically boosts conversions and sales by engaging your viewers. In no time, this will directly lead to sales.
* Content marketing involves building trust to create a long-term relationship. A good video will let people come to you because they know you got value, just as the video attests.
* It is a perfect form of igniting emotions and engaging your viewers. So, better give them quality content.
* Videos are good platforms for viewers to learn in detail. For example, a tutorial video will show clearly the steps to follow for a particular project until success.
* If you want your content to be widely accessed, then use a video to encourage social shares. Any good content will automatically find its way into the social world via shares among friends.

Step 4\. Organize your material  
Then begin to organize the files you have imported. You can create and use folders to sort out your files from the “My Album” section. Just click on the “Add a New Folder” icon to create a folder and rename it. Then arrange your footage as you wish.

Step 5\. Move your videos to the timeline  
Here is where you can edit your videos freely. Use the drag and drop feature to add them. You can also rearrange your files by dragging the files to the desired position in the timeline. You can then preview your videos by clicking the “Play” tab or using the “Playhead” to jump to a certain portion of the video.

Step 6\. Edit video  
Filmora lets you add effects and modify your video to your satisfaction. You can trim by dragging the end of a video clip on the right or left side. Likewise, you can apply other visual effects like insert transitions, add music, or even detach the audio and video to put background music of choice. More so, it’s easy to add text like opening titles, end credits, and so on to your video. Engage the available templates by dragging and dropping that of your choice to the timeline. Then add the appropriate text in Filmora’s preview window.

Step 7\. Export and Share  
Finally, you can export your video in any format. Just click on the "Export" button, and you'll be redirected to the "Output Window". Select the video file format in the "Format" menu and optimize your video YouTube.
