Have you seen everything on Netflix? Does nothing pique your interest in Hulu or Amazon Prime Video? Can I entice you with a free YouTube movie?

To watch full-length movies for free, you don't need to rent a movie or sign up for a YouTube Premium subscription. Hundreds of movies are accessible for free on YouTube if you don't mind having your movie-watching pleasure interrupted by the occasional ad.

If you're willing to pay to stream, YouTube boasts as large a collection of new movies as anyone. However, the video streaming site features a large, though difficult-to-find, a library of legal free movies. Not talking about strangely uploaded, blurry, shaky movies. Along with viral stars and adorable animal montages, genuine, 100 percent free (and good) movies are available.

## 1\. SUNRISE

Sunrise is one of the best free movies on YouTube, containing aspects of Silent, Romance, and Thriller. The film was directed by F.W. Murnau and was released in 1927\. The cast also includes Janet Gaynor, George O'Brien, and Margaret Livingston. The film is rated 8.1/10 on IMDB.

#### The plot of the movie

A farmer (George O'Brien) is bored with his wife (Janet Gaynor), their baby, and the monotony of farm life when he falls under the spell of a flirty city lady (Margaret Livingston), who persuades him to drown his wife so they can flee together. When his wife suspects his plot and flees to the city, the farmer pursues her, gradually recovering her trust as the two rediscover their love for each other in this award-winning silent classic.

## 2\. THE GENERAL

The General is one of the top free YouTube movies of the year 2021, combining Silent, Comedy, and Romance elements. The film was initially shown in 1926\. Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckham directed the picture. Starring are Joseph Keaton, Marion Mack, and Glen Cavender. In addition, the IMDB rating is 8.1/10.

#### The plot of the movie

One of the most revered silent-era comedies, this picture depicts hapless Southern railroad engineer Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) going up against Union forces during the American Civil War. When Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), Johnny's fiancée, is kidnapped while aboard a train taken by Northern forces, Gray follows the soldiers using various modes of transportation in entertaining action that showcases Keaton's inexhaustible wit and ability.

Have you seen everything on Netflix? Does nothing pique your interest in Hulu or Amazon Prime Video? Can I entice you with a free YouTube movie?

However, the video streaming site features a large, though difficult-to-find, a library of legal free movies. Not talking about strangely uploaded, blurry, shaky movies. Along with viral stars and adorable animal montages, genuine, 100 percent free (and good) movies are available.
