## What Is Youtube's Primary Goal?

YouTube was developed to allow anyone to upload any video content they wanted. On the site, users were anticipated to be allowed to upload, distribute, and watch content without restriction. It has subsequently grown to become one of the world's most popular video distribution platforms.

YouTube has evolved into a formidable platform for posting high-quality films with a range of settings and aspects over the years. It has also established a set of authoritarian rules and procedures for dealing with copyright issues as well as dangerous, offensive, and deceptive content. Do you make YouTube videos but are frustrated by the fact that you can only upload fifteen-minute recordings? All you need is quick account verification. This post will show you how to go about doing so.

Before you decide to submit a video, double-check that it doesn't infringe on anyone's copyright and that it follows YouTube's community guidelines. Let's have a look at what you need to do to upload longer videos on YouTube and ensure that it gets a lot of views before getting into the main guidelines and requirements.

## Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?

Yes, there is a restriction to the duration of videos that can be uploaded to YouTube. YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction.

Moreover, the length of a YouTube video is determined by whether or not your account is verified. Your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long or fewer if you aren't verified. Your YouTube videos can be up to 12 hours long or 128 GB in size if you are verified.

* Shorter videos were deemed to be superior... You'll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.
* Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven't noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they've seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials' videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.
* It's time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube's search, you'll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.
* As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as 'top producers,' such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you'll see an increase in subscribers.
* Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.

* Shorter videos were deemed to be superior... You'll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.
* Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven't noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they've seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials' videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.
* It's time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube's search, you'll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.
* As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as 'top producers,' such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you'll see an increase in subscribers.
* Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.
