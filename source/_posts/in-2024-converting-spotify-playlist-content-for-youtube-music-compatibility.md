## Part 6: Frequently Asked Question About Looping Videos on iPhone

1. **What is a looping video?**

It means a video that repeats for a specific number of times or maybe an unlimited amount of times automatically. For example, a GIF.

1. **Can I loop videos an unlimited number of times?**

Yes, it is possible to loop a video an unlimited amount of times. You can learn **how to loop a video on iPhone** by using the methods that we discussed above in the whole article. It is not possible to save the infinitely looping because it will take an infinite amount of memory.

1. **Does the view count if I play a YouTube video in a loop?**

No, YouTube will not count repeated views if they all come over and over again from the same sources. This is to maintain the overall quality of YouTube and make it scam-free.
