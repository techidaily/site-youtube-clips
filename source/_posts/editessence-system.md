## Why should we use Youtube Link Shorteners?

One of the vital reasons to use Youtube Link Shortener is to increase the click-throughs and shares. Short links are more prone to getting clicks and shares because they look simple and professional as compare to long and stuffy links. If we compare both the links, the short version, and the long version, we will clearly see the difference. The short links look more beautiful and attractive as compare to the long ones. Which means it can attract more people to click and share.

Another big advantage of shortened links is their usability of social platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others. These links take small space as well as help in making your post look appealing to the viewers.
