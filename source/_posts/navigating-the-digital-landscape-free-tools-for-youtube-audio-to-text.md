The good thing is, you can either use the automatic transcription feature that YouTube offers, or upload it manually while adjusting the timing as you go further.

Below are the two methods to transcribe your YouTube videos for free:

### Method 1: Use the Automated Transcription Service on YouTube

As the name suggests, YouTube automatic transcription service works automatically. This means you don’t even have to click the ‘Transcribe’ button anymore to **transcribe a YouTube video**, and the website takes care of it on its own. All you need to do is, choose English as the language of the video when setting up subtitles. You can follow the instructions given below to do so:

#### Step 1  Upload a Video

Sign in to your YouTube account, click your profile picture from the top-right corner, and click **YouTube Studio** from the menu. Next, click **CREATE** from the upper-right corner, click **Upload videos** from the menu, and drag and drop a video from your computer to the **Upload videos** box that appears next.

#### Step 2  Select Transcription Language

On the **Details** page of the next box that appears, scroll down and click **MORE OPTIONS**, and select **English** in the **Video language** drop-down list under the **Language, subtitles, and closed captions (CC)** section.

![Select Language on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-language-on-youtube.jpg)

#### Step 3  Publish the Video

Follow the on-screen instructions from this point to publish the video, and wait while YouTube automatically transcribes and [adds the close captions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to it.

**Note:** Depending on the duration of the clip, the time YouTube would take to transcribe may vary.

After YouTube has transcribed the video, you can **download the transcription file** in your preferred format. The instructions are given below explain how you can do so:

1. **Get to the Subtitles Window**

While on the **YouTube Studio** page, click **Subtitles** from the left pane to go to the **Channel subtitles** page. And then click the video you want to modify.

### Method 2: Get YouTube Transcription when Watching

In addition, if you are watching any other video, you can make YouTube transcribe that for you as well. You can follow the instructions given below to get the **YouTube video to text transcription**:

#### Limitations of Using YouTube Transcribe

Although YouTube’s automatic transcription is a decent feature that saves you a lot of time, since Google uses machine learning algorithms to convert the speech to text, the level of accuracy may vary depending on the accent of the speaker, and the clarity of the audio the video has. Also, even sometime you may not be satisfied with the end-results.

## Part 3: Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos

You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you **transcribe a YouTube video**, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:

* **Search Engine Optimization**

When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.

* **Accent**

If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.

* **Repurposing on Blogs**

If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.

### YouTube Video Transcription FAQs

#### 1. How to Transcribe YouTube Video to Text

Usually the transcription files have \*.srt extension that are globally accepted and supported by almost all media players. However, there might be instances when you want to have the subtitles in plain text.

That said, to convert an SRT file to TXT, you can:

* Right-click the **SRT** file
* Go to **Rename**
* Replace **srt** with **txt** and press **Enter**
* Click **OK** on the confirmation box that appears next to convert SRT to TXT

After this, you can simply double-click the file, and read and modify the transcribed content as needed.

#### 2. How to Edit and Upload Edited Transcript to YouTube

If you made any modifications to the transcript that was automatically generated by YouTube or any other third-party transcription tool, you can follow the steps given below to upload the new file to the YouTube video:

* Go to **YouTube Studio** and then to the **Channel subtitles** page as explained earlier
* Expand the **Languages** column of the target video
* Click the **Options** icon that appears under the **Subtitles** column when you hover mouse on to it
* Click **Edit on Classic Studio**
* On the next page, click **Edit** from the top-right corner

![Edit YouTube subtitles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-automatic-youtube-video-transcription.jpg)

* Click to open the **Actions** drop-down list from the upper-left corner
* Click **Upload a file**
  * Follow the on-screen instructions from there to upload the modified transcription file
  * Click **Save Changes** from the top-right corner of the page when done

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for a quick and easy way of adding subtitles to your videos, letting **YouTube transcribe** for you could be a good approach. However, because these auto-generated transcriptions are created by machine learning algorithms, their accuracy cannot be counted on. Therefore, the best way to get the job done accurately is, let YouTube auto-transcribe your video, download the transcription file, make the necessary changes to it, and then upload the file back to the video.

* Go to **YouTube Studio** and then to the **Channel subtitles** page as explained earlier
* Expand the **Languages** column of the target video

Below are the two methods to transcribe your YouTube videos for free:

### Method 1: Use the Automated Transcription Service on YouTube

As the name suggests, YouTube automatic transcription service works automatically. This means you don’t even have to click the ‘Transcribe’ button anymore to **transcribe a YouTube video**, and the website takes care of it on its own.

On the **Details** page of the next box that appears, scroll down and click **MORE OPTIONS**, and select **English** in the **Video language** drop-down list under the **Language, subtitles, and closed captions (CC)** section.

#### Step 3  Publish the Video

Follow the on-screen instructions from this point to publish the video, and wait while YouTube automatically transcribes and [adds the close captions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to it.

**Note:** Depending on the duration of the clip, the time YouTube would take to transcribe may vary.

After YouTube has transcribed the video, you can **download the transcription file** in your preferred format. The instructions are given below explain how you can do so:

## Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have

As much as the enthusiasm is brewing to get on your mac and upload the video you just shot, there are certain elements you need to implement to make a cool video for YouTube. Beginners sometimes feel their content is the best, the excitement of posting their very first series can be overwhelming. Sometimes, it blocks off other ideas for making the video better.

However, having amazing content dies not to exclude the need for the right editing technique. Here are five methods for editing your YouTube videos:

### 1.Control the video duration

The length of a particular scene can have different meanings depending on how long or short it is in a video. This means the duration can impact the message you are trying to pass across to your viewers, hence it is important to know what places to accelerate and cut in the video.

You can have a system where each part of the content is labeled in their order of importance such as A, B, C. This means from the most important to the least important. Consequently, you will be able to sieve through the content and make the appropriate changes while editing the video.

### 2.Customize the intro and end of the video

It is possible to grab the attention of the viewer in the intro and even more likely to lose someone once the opening montage comes in. Creating an intro that is captivating and appealing to drag the audience to your video is an important technique for editing your videos. Also, the end of the video, from the signing out to the closing montage has to appeal to the audience. You will be surprised by the number of people that love seeing end credits if the closing montage is good. Customize the intro and the end of the video so the audience is tuned all through.
