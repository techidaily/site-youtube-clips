## Compare Vimeo, YouTube, and DailyMotion in 4 Aspects

#### 1\.  Content

![video content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-content.jpg)

Before deciding which video platform to choose, you need to find out about the content in which each of them specializes.

**Youtube:** If your content is more related to entertainment then YouTube is the platform to go for.

 **Vimeo:** Vimeo is a closed community specializing in videos by artists from various genres and is considered to be a more creative platform than YouTube.

**Dailymotion:** Dailymotion has a fair share of both but it resembles the YouTube trend.

#### 2\.  Audience Size and Membership

![audience youtube vimeo dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audience-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** YouTube’s audience is large, with over 1 billion users that watch hundreds of millions of hours of content – each day! Vimeo has a much smaller for their audience, its 170 million viewers, about 42 million are in the United States.

**Vimeo:** Vimeo comes with 4 membership options – the Basic which is available for free and the paid Plus, ($59.95/ year) Pro ($199.00 a year), and Business membership ($599.00 a year). The storage level and support for each membership option vary. The free membership is limited to just 500 MB/week. YouTube and Dailymotion on the other hand are totally free, and Youtube gives unlimited hosting. However YouTube Red is a $9.99 subscription service that will allow you to watch ad-free videos and download them for watching offline.

**Dailymotion:** DailyMotion is the world's second-largest video-sharing website behind YouTube, statistics claimed by both companies show that YouTube has a significant advantage over DailyMotion in terms of unique site visits, totaling one billion visits per month compared with DailyMotion's 112 million visits per month.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![video limit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videolimit-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** One of the best parts about this platform is that it doesn’t come with any upload limit.

**Dailymotion:** Regular users can upload 60 minutes videos of 2 GB limit and the quality of upload is limited to 1280 720p.

**Vimeo:** With a Basic plan, you can upload 500MB/week, with a Plus plan you can upload 5GB/week and with Pro plan you will be able to upload unlimited videos with a per-file limit of 25 GB.

#### 4\.  User Experience

To begin with, both Vimeo and YouTube had a very similar kind of user interface. This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion/month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.

## Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo

![video limit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videolimit-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** One of the best parts about this platform is that it doesn’t come with any upload limit.

**Dailymotion:** Regular users can upload 60 minutes videos of 2 GB limit and the quality of upload is limited to 1280 720p.

**Vimeo:** With a Basic plan, you can upload 500MB/week, with a Plus plan you can upload 5GB/week and with Pro plan you will be able to upload unlimited videos with a per-file limit of 25 GB.

#### 4\.  User Experience

To begin with, both Vimeo and YouTube had a very similar kind of user interface. This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion/month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.
