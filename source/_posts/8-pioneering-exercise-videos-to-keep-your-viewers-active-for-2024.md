#### 1.  How to Work Out

![YouTube Fitness Video Ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fitness-youtube-video-ideas.jpg)

Life is a process of constantly learning how to do new things, and educational videos on YouTube allow us to learn whatever we want. Most people don't know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.

#### 2.  Vitamins, Supplements

There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.

If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.

#### 3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts

No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube's community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.

#### 4.  Stretch Videos

Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.

#### 5.  Full-length Workout Videos

There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.

#### 6.  Yoga Routine

Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can't learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they'll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.

#### 7.  Exercise Plans

We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.

#### 8.  Motivational Video

The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.

#### 9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information

We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.

#### 10.  Your Fitness Journey

Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.

#### 11.  Weight Loss Advice

For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease. That's why YouTube videos that offer advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way, or which provide guidance through the process, can help you build an audience on YouTube.

On the main interface, click the **Preview quality and display settings** icon from the upper-right area of the Timeline, click **Change Project Aspect Ratio**, click to select **1280 x 720 (HD)** from the **Resolution** menu of the **Project Settings** box, and click **OK** to save the custom project settings.

![Filmora Mac start interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-mac-start-interface.jpg)

Then select **My Media** from the menu bar if not already selected, click **Project Media** from the navigation pane, and click **Import** from the **Media** box to select and import the image of the main character or object that you want to use in the thumbnail.

![Import videos to Filmora  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-change-aspect-ratio-filmora.jpg)

Now, drag the image from the **Media** box to the Timeline at the bottom.

**Step 2: Clear Image Background, Add Border, and Add Custom Background**

Go to **Effects** from the menu bar, click to select the **Default** tab and then **AI Portrait** from the navigation pane, and click and drag the **Human Segmentation** preset from the right box, and place it over the image track in the Timeline.

![add human segmentation effect to youtube thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-segmentation-remove-background.jpg)

Double-click the image layer, scroll down the upper-left box to the **Video Effects** section, and use the **Edge Thickness** and **Edge Feather** sliders to adjust the character’s edges to make them as realistic as possible. Click **OK** when done.

![adjust thumbnail border settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-border-settings.jpg)

Next, click and drag the **Human Border** preset over the image track in the Timeline, and follow the same procedure to customize the border. This will give the character a **neon border** effect.

![adjust thumbnail border settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-border-effects.jpg)

Now, use the method explained earlier to import a custom image for the background, and drag and place it under the previous track in the Timeline.

![adjust border to photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-photo-to-border.jpg)

If you are running the latest version of Filmora, you will find there are some neon light effects available under AI Portrait as well.

**Step 3: Add Titles to Thumbnail**

Go to **Titles** from the menu bar, click to select the **Default** tab and then **Lower 3rds** from the navigation pane, and click and drag your preferred lower-third preset from the right window to a separate layer in the Timeline. Double-click the lower-third layer, and use the available options in the upper-left window to change the text, its color, etc., and drag the textbox to place it to your preferred position on the image as well. Click **OK** to save the changes.

Next, click to select **Titles** from the navigation pane, and drag your preferred title from the right window to the upper-most track in the Timeline. Now use the method explained earlier to edit the text, its color, position, etc. to make it look professional.

Click the **Snapshot** (**Camera**) icon from the upper-right area of the Timeline, go to **My Media** from the menu bar, right-click the thumbnail of the screenshot you captured, and click **Reveal in Finder** (on Mac) or **Reveal in Explorer** (on Windows) to get to the folder the **YouTube thumbnail border** is saved in.

## Part 2: How to Add a Glowing Neon Border in Your YouTube Thumbnail with Canva

Canva is another intuitive editing program that works on the web interface rather than having you download and install an app on your PC. You can add a **neon border** for YouTube thumbnails using Canva by following the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Define Project Settings and Add a Background**

After signing in to your Canva account, click **Create a design** from the top-right corner of the page, click **Custom size** from the bottom, define **1280** and **720** in the **Width** and **Height** fields on the box that appears respectively, and click **Create new design**.

![add neon border to thumbnail in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-neon-border-canva.jpg)

Now, click to select **Background** from the navigation bar on the left (if the **Background** tool is not visible, click **More** and then choose **Background** from the expanded list), and click to select a background from the images available in the center pane.

![ choose background in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-choose-background.jpg)

**Step 2: Upload an Image and Add Effects**

Click **Uploads** from the navigation bar, click the **More** icon from the right of the **Upload media** button present at the top of the center pane, choose your preferred method to upload the image (with the transparent background) that you want to use, upload the image, and drag it from the center pane to the Canvas.

**Note:** You can use any of the tools available online to remove the background from your image for free.

![upload thumbnail in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-thumbnail-canva.jpg)

To add a **YouTube thumbnail border**, make sure that the image that you added to the Canvas is selected, click the **Duplicate** icon from the upper-right area, and use the scaling handles of the copy of the image to increase its size a bit. Reposition the image back to its original location as well.

Then, click **Edit image** from the upper-left corner of the Canvas, click **Duotone** from the **Edit image** pane at the center, if need be, click **See all**, choose your preferred duotone effect to apply on the image, choose your preferred highlight and shadow colors from the box that appears next, and click **Back** from the top of the pane.

![Canva edit image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-edit-image-duotone.jpg)

Next, click **See all** next to the **Adjust** section from the center pane, and drag the **Blur** slider to the right to increase the blur effect on the image.

![blur thumbnail image in Canva  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-thumbnail-canva.jpg)

**Step 3: Position the Layers**

While keeping the duplicate image selected, click the **Position** button from the upper-right area of the Canvas, and click **Background** to send the second image behind the first one to get the **neon border** effect for the photo.

## Part 3: How to Outline a Person in a YouTube Thumbnail with Photoshop

Because YouTube thumbnails are nothing but static images, creating **YouTube thumbnail border** with Adobe Photoshop is comparatively easier. The process of doing this is given below:

**Step 1: Define Document Preferences and Import an Image**

Launch Adobe Photoshop on your PC, click **Create new**, and on the **New Document** customization box, define the width and height values to **1280** and **720** pixels respectively. Select **Transparent** from the **Background Contents** menu as well if not already selected. Click **Create** from the bottom to create a new Photoshop document with the specified document settings. Next, open the folder that contains the source image, drag the photo to Photoshop, and press **Enter** to place the photo.

![import thumbnail image to ps  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-youtube-thumbnail-photoshop.jpg)

**Step 2: Remove Background from the Image**

Make sure that the image layer is selected in the **Layers** panel on the right, go to **Select** from the menu bar at the top, and click **Subject**. From the bottom of the **Layers** panel, click the **Add a mask** icon to get rid of the background, leaving only the human on the Canvas.

![remove thumbnail background in ps  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-thumbnail-background.jpg)

**Step 3: Add a Custom Background and an Outline Around the Subject**

Use the method explained earlier to import a background image of your choice to Photoshop. Drag the background image layer to the bottom in the **Layers** panel. Double-click the masked layer, click to select **Stroke** from the left pane of the **Layer Style** box, and use the options available on the right to manage the size, color, position, etc. of the stroke that has been added around the human subject. Click **OK** when done, and then export the image normally to use it as a **YouTube thumbnail border**.

![outline thumbnail border in ps  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/outline-neon-border-photoshop.jpg)

**Summary**

It is important to know that the default resolution of a YouTube thumbnail is 1280 x 720 pixels that is usually written and referred to as 720p. While adding a **YouTube thumbnail border**, it is also imperative to have a good sense of color combination and fonts. Furthermore, a decent tool like Wondershare Filmora X must be used to add an appealing **neon border** around the main subject in the thumbnail image easily and quickly.
