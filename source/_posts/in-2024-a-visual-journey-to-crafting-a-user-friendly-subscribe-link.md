If you want to increase the total number of subscribers that you have on your YouTube page it is important that your page is easy to subscribe to.

A subscribe link is a link to your channel page which takes the person who clicks it to the same view of the page they would have if they had already clicked to subscribe. It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.

A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.

## How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link

YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!

**Step 1:** Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.

**Step 2:** Add the following to the end of your channel URL:

?sub\_confirmation=1

**Step 3:** Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.

This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:

_<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w>_

That's a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor's YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:

_<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1>_

Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking. The process for creating a YouTube subscribe link is easy and accessible to everyone.

### Touch Up Your YouTube Videos with Filmora

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) features lots of video and audio editing tools that enables you to cut, trim and touch up the video clip easily. There are plentiful texts templates and elements, which can be used to create attractive call-outs.

The point is that your intro should be to the point. It means that you must never prolong your intro for any reason. Again here comes the element of relevancy.

It means that you must keep your intro as short as possible as it allows you to capture the audience in a far better manner. A short intro will make sure that you are getting the attention that you need when it comes to your channel. So it will boost your channel traffic a lot.

**3\. It must be in line with your channel theme**

Again it is critical that your intro is relevant to your channel. It means that the intro made should represent your channel’s content instead of anything else. It will make sure that you get the best and most relevant audience.

This will once again boost your channel as well as traffic surge will also occur. You will get the best outcome that will make it possible for you to channel the traffic wherever you want. This, in turn, will also boost your channel revenue in case of monetization.

**4\. Awesome Music**

It is the most important part that will impact your YouTube intro. Good music will make sure that you get the best outcome and the users are attracted. There are many YouTube channels that were only recognized as their music was awesome.

**5\. Clean Visuals**

HD and the high quality intro is the key to your channel’s success. It is highly regarded as the best way to attract people. You must spend time to make sure that it looks great and to the point. This is one of the ways to make sure that your intro looks good and awesome.

**6\. Technically Sound**

It is again important to note that technically the intro that has been made is sound and is to the point. From transitions to fade and from animations to PIP there are a lot of details that should be taken care of. It will make sure that you get the intro that is highly professional and specialized.
