Then choose the picture and move your mouse to expand the picture exposure time frame exactly as long as your MP3 file. If less, the remaining part will be blacked out, while too long will create silence in the overextended portions of the video.

A YouTube trailer is a short intro video for your channel. What do you do? What is your content? It is a brief video that helps the new audience understand your channel.

In other words, a YouTube trailer is necessary for your channel. It will give the audience a better understanding of yourself and what to expect from your YouTube channel.

##### Step1 Start with a hook

Your first step will be to find a way to engage your audience so that they will be interested in your channel or content from the very beginning. To do this, follow the below steps and enjoy the next with your audience.

![a good startup of a trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-1.gif)

**For example**

Step1 Ask a **question**.

Step2 Start with a **problem** and a solution.

Step3 Use a hypothetical situation with the words like "What if."

Step4 Open with an **exciting** **fact**

Step5 Tell a story without finishing it.

The trick here is to get the viewers' attention within 5 seconds, so they're interested in your channel from the beginning. Also, it intrigues them to keep watching.

##### Step2 Tell a little about yourself

Make a short intro, depending on the content and your presence on the screen. Again, developing a friendly relationship between the viewers and yourself is beneficial.

![self-introduction example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-2.gif)

You can add a quick introduction about yourself and your backstory. It will create a sense of personal attachment to the channel and help you engage better with the audience.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** keep in mind to make a short intro. Please don't spend too much time on it. And remember, it's all about the audience.

##### Step3 Show, not just tell

Showing the audience what the channel is about is essential. Therefore, you need to spend some time selecting your best footage and graphics to showcase and illustrate your content.

One of the easiest ways is to use perfect music. So if you want to know how to select the right song, go and look at our new release,[the power of music](https://youtu.be/DSyxd9ARmsc), where we teach you everything you need to know for this.

##### Step4 Channel values

Here, you should explain to your audience the purpose of your channel and what they can expect from you. At this stage, new potential viewers can get you, whether your goal is to entertain them, teach something specific, or discuss certain topics and how you intend to achieve them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![an example of a creative trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-3.jpg)

**Determine the style of your video**

You can refer to the most popular style in your area. Then, making the possibilities endless, you name it!

* A **vlogger video,** in which you have to record your daily activities. You can utilize a special occasion or a visit to historical sites or other landscapes of nature.
* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.

##### Step5 Schedule

Schedules are vital if you want regularly engaging viewers. The audience will be kept track of your activities and be there as soon as you upload your video. Also, new viewers know when to expect new content from you and commit to your goal, so they know your strategy.

**For example**

Step1 Ask a **question**.

Step2 Start with a **problem** and a solution.

Step3 Use a hypothetical situation with the words like "What if."

Step4 Open with an **exciting** **fact**

Step5 Tell a story without finishing it.

The trick here is to get the viewers' attention within 5 seconds, so they're interested in your channel from the beginning. Also, it intrigues them to keep watching.

##### Step2 Tell a little about yourself

Make a short intro, depending on the content and your presence on the screen. Again, developing a friendly relationship between the viewers and yourself is beneficial.

You can add a quick introduction about yourself and your backstory. It will create a sense of personal attachment to the channel and help you engage better with the audience.

**Note:** keep in mind to make a short intro. Please don't spend too much time on it. And remember, it's all about the audience.

##### Step3 Show, not just tell

Showing the audience what the channel is about is essential. Therefore, you need to spend some time selecting your best footage and graphics to showcase and illustrate your content.

One of the easiest ways is to use perfect music. So if you want to know how to select the right song, go and look at our new release,[the power of music](https://youtu.be/DSyxd9ARmsc), where we teach you everything you need to know for this.

##### Step4 Channel values

Here, you should explain to your audience the purpose of your channel and what they can expect from you. At this stage, new potential viewers can get you, whether your goal is to entertain them, teach something specific, or discuss certain topics and how you intend to achieve them.

**Determine the style of your video**

You can refer to the most popular style in your area. Then, making the possibilities endless, you name it!

* A **vlogger video,** in which you have to record your daily activities. You can utilize a special occasion or a visit to historical sites or other landscapes of nature.
* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.

##### Step5 Schedule

Schedules are vital if you want regularly engaging viewers. The audience will be kept track of your activities and be there as soon as you upload your video. Also, new viewers know when to expect new content from you and commit to your goal, so they know your strategy.
