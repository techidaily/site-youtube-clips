As the world has progressed, a great deal has changed, and it has transformed into a digital hub. People have started to use different platforms to entertain themselves, watch their favorite content online, gaming, music, sports, or any other form of entertainment.

Cross-platform streaming is a concept people have started to follow especially when it comes to gaming. The audience has a wide variety of choices when it comes to viewing live content online.

YouTube and Twitch are two major platforms streamers use to publish their content online for their targeted audience. They need to stream their content on YouTube and Twitch simultaneously as it engages a wider range of audiences worldwide, and newer streamers can benefit from it.

Part 1: [How Can You Stream on Twitch and YouTube at the Same Time?](#step1)

Part 2: [How to Multi-stream using Streamlabs Prime](#step2)

Part 3: [Bonus Tips | Enlarge your Live Stream Performance!](#step3)

## Part 1: How Can You Stream on Twitch and YouTube at the Same Time?

To stream simultaneously on multiple platforms, a certain program or application is required to provide you with the required tools to enable you to broadcast your content. Several programs provide the option to stream to multiple websites at the same time e.g., Restream, Streamlabs Prime, and MelonApp.

### Restream

Restream.io is a service that provides you with the option to broadcast your content to more than 30 different platforms including Twitch and YouTube. When you log in, you can choose the channels you wish to broadcast on and restream will issue a unique key for you.

![Restream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-1.jpg)

After you have selected your desired selection, go to your broadcasting software, and choose Restream.io as your preferred service and insert your unique key provided by Restream.

Restream will let you use their services for free provided you use it with their watermark. It is recommended for newer users but if you wish to remove the watermark and go ad-free you will have to upgrade your plan.

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you stream using Restream.io

### Step 1: Sign up or log in

The first step is to sign up on Restream. It will require you to choose a unique username, password and enter a valid email address.

### Step 2: Choose your desired Platforms

From the list of different platforms, choose the ones you wish to stream to and add your channels by authorizing with the required credentials. Restream has an option of more than 30 platforms including YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

![Choose your desired Platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Choose your subscription plan

Choose your desired plan that caters to your needs. Keep in mind that Restream is 100% free but free accounts do not come with recording or storage and will show a Restream watermark.

![Choose your subscription plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-3.jpg)

You can remove this watermark by upgrading your subscription plan to a Professional one from the dashboard.

### Step 4: Choose the final streaming platforms

Connect all your channels so you can stream from a single platform. Click the platform icon and connect your preferred accounts with Restream.

### Step 5: Tweak the settings according to your preference

Set up for streaming preferences and settings along with your streaming software. You can broadcast directly from your browser, multiple members from different locations, from your mobile phone, or even your GoPro. More available streaming features can be found on the Restream Help Center.

![Set up for streaming preferences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-4.jpg)

Restream also offers a wide range of services including the option to stream pre-recorded videos on Twitch at a preselected time and date. However, there is a caveat that you will not be able to multi-stream after you get an affiliate status on your Twitch channel.

## Part 2: How to Multi-stream using Streamlabs Prime

Streamlabs Prime is the premium version of Streamlabs. It provides you with a range of 40+ apps that can also improve the quality of your streams and allow you to multi-stream. It is one of the best streaming software in the game currently.

Many content creators use Streamlabs to simultaneously run their streams on YouTube along with Twitch to grasp a wider range of audiences and get more views. One of the best things about Streamlabs is that you can connect to the broadcast services directly from the program without entering any stream key.

Streamlabs has included the option to Multi Stream on different platforms within its OBS client. Below are the steps required to set you up for streaming on YouTube and Twitch at the same time.

### Step 1: Open the settings of your desired client

Click on the gear icon to open the settings on the bottom left of the client, click on the Stream tab where you will see the three main platforms for streaming.

### Step 2: Add your preferred platforms

Add YouTube and Twitch by pressing the connect button; you can also add other services as well with the Add Destination feature.

![Add your preferred platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-5.jpg)

Your stream will automatically be broadcast to all selected platforms when you go live. Although, you will be required to use the premium service of Streamlabs to ensure you can Multistream to different platforms at the same time.
