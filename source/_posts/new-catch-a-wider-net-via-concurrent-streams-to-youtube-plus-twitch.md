Part 3: [Bonus Tips | Enlarge your Live Stream Performance!](#step3)

## Part 1: How Can You Stream on Twitch and YouTube at the Same Time?

To stream simultaneously on multiple platforms, a certain program or application is required to provide you with the required tools to enable you to broadcast your content. Several programs provide the option to stream to multiple websites at the same time e.g., Restream, Streamlabs Prime, and MelonApp.

### Restream

Restream.io is a service that provides you with the option to broadcast your content to more than 30 different platforms including Twitch and YouTube. When you log in, you can choose the channels you wish to broadcast on and restream will issue a unique key for you.

After you have selected your desired selection, go to your broadcasting software, and choose Restream.io as your preferred service and insert your unique key provided by Restream.

Restream will let you use their services for free provided you use it with their watermark. It is recommended for newer users but if you wish to remove the watermark and go ad-free you will have to upgrade your plan.

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you stream using Restream.io

### Step 1: Sign up or log in

The first step is to sign up on Restream. It will require you to choose a unique username, password and enter a valid email address.

### Step 2: Choose your desired Platforms

From the list of different platforms, choose the ones you wish to stream to and add your channels by authorizing with the required credentials. Restream has an option of more than 30 platforms including YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

### Step 3: Choose your subscription plan

Choose your desired plan that caters to your needs. Keep in mind that Restream is 100% free but free accounts do not come with recording or storage and will show a Restream watermark.

![Choose your subscription plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/multistream-on-youtube-and-twitch-3.jpg)

You can remove this watermark by upgrading your subscription plan to a Professional one from the dashboard.

### Step 4: Choose the final streaming platforms

Connect all your channels so you can stream from a single platform. Click the platform icon and connect your preferred accounts with Restream.

### Step 5: Tweak the settings according to your preference

Set up for streaming preferences and settings along with your streaming software. You can broadcast directly from your browser, multiple members from different locations, from your mobile phone, or even your GoPro. More available streaming features can be found on the Restream Help Center.

Restream also offers a wide range of services including the option to stream pre-recorded videos on Twitch at a preselected time and date. However, there is a caveat that you will not be able to multi-stream after you get an affiliate status on your Twitch channel.

## Part 2: How to Multi-stream using Streamlabs Prime

Streamlabs Prime is the premium version of Streamlabs. It provides you with a range of 40+ apps that can also improve the quality of your streams and allow you to multi-stream. It is one of the best streaming software in the game currently.

### Tip # 6: Promote Your Content Using Social Media

Multi-streaming helps build up a wider community of fans as it is targeting different sets of people and you can also earn from your streams using advertisements and introducing click-on banners for brand endorsements.

Some platforms also let you promote and manage your merchandise, so it is always a good opportunity for these streaming clients and platforms.

## Conclusion

Now you can also monetize your streams and broadcast on different platforms such as YouTube and Twitch at the same time. This will boost your reach and views in a very positive way. You can also tweak your content by editing it and inserting sound effects, gifs, and much more to make it more interesting and catchier.

And by multi-streaming on YouTube and Twitch, you will have a greater chance of being found by gaming sponsors and your growth will not be tied just to a single platform. You can also promote your streams on other social media platforms and your handles as well.

Pre-recorded videos are also a great way to present your content with perfection without any chances of being prone to any potential online mishaps.
