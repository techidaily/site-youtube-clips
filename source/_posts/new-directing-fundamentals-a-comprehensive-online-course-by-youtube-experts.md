### **Step 4: Place Files on the Timeline**

Time to start editing your video. Place the video and audio files on the timeline while removing the redundant parts. Use the drag-and-drop feature to edit the clips, one at a time, cutting out unneeded footage to have a clear story.

![edit files from the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-creator-studio-unlocking-the-power-of-your-channel-10.JPG)

### **Step 5: Apply Visual Effects**

After removing the unwanted parts from the video clips, detach the audio and video files. Insert transitions between clips, add music, and use other visual effects on Filmora to make the video more exciting.

### **Step 6: Conduct the Color Correction Process**

The effects icon gives you access to filters and overlays to make your video colors more vivid. Select the filters of choice, and drag and drop it to where you want to use on the timeline.

### **Step 7: Export and Share**

Once you are satisfied with the video outcome, export it in MP4 format, ready for upload on YouTube. Save it in your local drive, and upload it to YouTube via the Creator Studio.
