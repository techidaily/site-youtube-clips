If we talk about post-production techniques and visual effects, then [Split Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has to be one of the smartest picks. After all, it lets us narrate our story via two (or more) screens and gives our audience a superior viewing experience. Though, a lot of users find it hard to implement the split-screen effect on YouTube videos. Here, I will let you know how to come up with all kinds of YouTube split-screen videos by using a professional video editor.

## Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos

Before we discuss how to work on YouTube split-screen videos, let’s quickly consider some major applications of this video effect.

* ### To draw a direct comparison

One of the most popular applications of split-screen videos is for comparing two or more instances or perspectives in the same frame. For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.

![split screen video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg)

* ### To provide two or more perspectives

Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.

One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.

* ### To implement the cloning effect

Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background. Later, we implement a split-screen effect in which both the clips are combined in such a way that it makes the audience believe as if the scene has both, the character and their clone placed flawlessly.
