## What is sub for sub?

Subforsub means a subscription for a subscription. In this practice, there are subscribers and subscriptions. Those who subscribe to you on YouTube are the subscribers while those whom you subscribe to, are the subscriptions. Both video makers’ subscribers are, therefore, increased equally and doesn’t give each other a competitive advantage against the other member. Sub for sub was founded in Germany, 4 years ago. It is easy to use and free platform that takes only about 5 minutes to contact a subscriber and complete the initiative. To get started, a user signs up and creates a new account on the home page. You can then reach out to other members for a subscription.

## How does sub for sub work?

With YouTube sub for sub, you market your YouTube channel to get more subscribers. Simply sub to one another’s channel and they sub back.

You can do this on different channels such as YouTube live videos, among other channels. But again, these subscribers are not so much concerned about getting the real subs. What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers. And since they don’t watch your videos, neither will they share them with other viewers.

A user should only run one genuine YouTube account. However, the trick that most subscribers use to gain more subs is by creating other additional fake accounts to gain more subs in return. But again, it is not a guarantee as some subscribers may not sub back to all the accounts.

#### \- Subscribers don’t watch the videos

Perhaps there is no time for subscribers to watch the potential sub videos before subscribing. Your mission is to gain as many subs as possible even if your watch time doesn’t go up. This doesn’t bring any positivity to your channel rather an increased number of subscribers.

#### \- Reach out to friends

## What is sub for sub?

Subforsub means a subscription for a subscription. In this practice, there are subscribers and subscriptions. Those who subscribe to you on YouTube are the subscribers while those whom you subscribe to, are the subscriptions. Both video makers’ subscribers are, therefore, increased equally and doesn’t give each other a competitive advantage against the other member. Sub for sub was founded in Germany, 4 years ago. It is easy to use and free platform that takes only about 5 minutes to contact a subscriber and complete the initiative. To get started, a user signs up and creates a new account on the home page.

## How does sub for sub work?

With YouTube sub for sub, you market your YouTube channel to get more subscribers. Simply sub to one another’s channel and they sub back.

What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers. And since they don’t watch your videos, neither will they share them with other viewers.

## Tips & tricks to use sub for sub
