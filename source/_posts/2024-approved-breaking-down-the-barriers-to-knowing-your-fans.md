## Part 1: How to See Your YouTube Subscribers List?

Finding out who your subscribers are on YouTube is a simple process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort.

1\. In order to do so, you first need to go to your channel's home page and then click on the Creator Studio icon located in the upper right corner of the screen next to your profile picture.

![YouTube Subscriber Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-create-studio.jpg)

You can also access the Creator Studio by clicking on your icon in the top right corner of any screen on YouTube and selecting it from the drop-down menu.

2\. Once the Creator Studio opens, you'll be able to see different menus such as Analytics and Video Manager.

3\. You'll need to click on the Community menu, which provides insight into messages or comments among other things.

![YouTube Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-community-create-studio.jpg)

4\. Select the Subscribers option from the menu and wait for the list of the subscribers to appear on your screen. You'll be able to see a list of YouTube users that have subscribed to your channel.

![Finding YouTube Subscribers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-community.jpg)

Constantly checking the list of subscribers is a great way to keep track of new subscribers to your channel, which is important if you want to know how many new subscribers you got within a day or a week.

If you would like to go through a more detailed tutorial about how to see who your subscribers are, click [here and learn each step of this simple process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKndwFejMow)

If you’re using YouTube Studio, you can go to the **Recent subscribers** card on the Dashboard, and then click **SEE ALL** to check the list of the recent subscribers.

![ See YouTube Subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-youtube-studio.jpg)

## Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular

The list of subscribers to your channel offered by YouTube's Creator Studio can be used for a variety of different purposes. You can compare your channel to channels with a similar number of subscribers, or you can find out how many users that have subscribed to your channel have around the same (or even more) subscribers than you do. If you are thinking about [creating a collab video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-collab-videos-and-grow-your-channel-206.html), your list of subscribers can be a great source of potential partners.

So in order to see which of your subscribers are the most popular, you simply need to change the settings in the Subscribers panel from most recent to most popular.

## Part 3: How to See Other People’s Subscribers

Seeing the list of subscribers on other people's channels is no longer possible on YouTube, even though it was a common feature in the past.

What you can do is select one of your subscribers from the subscriber list on your channel, and go to their channel and then click on the About option that will show you the number of subscribers and the total number of views to the channel (or [use one of these tools to see the sub count of any channel in real-time](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Unfortunately, YouTube channel owners can no longer browse through other people's subscribers and for that reason, their interactions with potential subscribers are somewhat limited.

If you want to get more subscribers, you must consider your channel's branding. Want to improve your branding? [Click here to see examples from popular channels that have nailed their brand.](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-brand-your-youtube-channel-to-get-more-subscribers-411.html)

## Platform Power Play: Which One Dominates - Vimeo, YouTube+DailyMotion?

# Vimeo vs YouTube vs Dailymotion: Which Video Platform is Right for You?

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

If you are an upcoming entrepreneur who is looking forward to an effective video marketing strategy then you have to come to a decision regarding the portal you want to use for your marketing. As you should know by now [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/) and [Vimeo](https://www.vimeo.com/)are the 3 major players in the field of video marketing. In this article, we are going to give you a comparative analysis of all these video sharing platforms so that you can select the one most suited to your needs.

![Vimeo vs. YouTube vs. Dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-youtube-dailymotion.png)

* [Part 1: Detailed Comparison of Vimeo, YouTube, and DailyMotion](#part1)
* [Part 2: Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo](#part2)

## Compare Vimeo, YouTube, and DailyMotion in 4 Aspects

#### 1\.  Content

![video content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-content.jpg)

Before deciding which video platform to choose, you need to find out about the content in which each of them specializes.

**Youtube:** If your content is more related to entertainment then YouTube is the platform to go for.

 **Vimeo:** Vimeo is a closed community specializing in videos by artists from various genres and is considered to be a more creative platform than YouTube.

**Dailymotion:** Dailymotion has a fair share of both but it resembles the YouTube trend.

#### 2\.  Audience Size and Membership

![audience youtube vimeo dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audience-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** YouTube’s audience is large, with over 1 billion users that watch hundreds of millions of hours of content – each day! Vimeo has a much smaller for their audience, its 170 million viewers, about 42 million are in the United States.

**Vimeo:** Vimeo comes with 4 membership options – the Basic which is available for free and the paid Plus, ($59.95/ year) Pro ($199.00 a year), and Business membership ($599.00 a year). The storage level and support for each membership option vary. The free membership is limited to just 500 MB/week. YouTube and Dailymotion on the other hand are totally free, and Youtube gives unlimited hosting. However YouTube Red is a $9.99 subscription service that will allow you to watch ad-free videos and download them for watching offline.

 _Read this [Vimeo introduction >>>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)_

**Dailymotion:** DailyMotion is the world's second-largest video-sharing website behind YouTube, statistics claimed by both companies show that YouTube has a significant advantage over DailyMotion in terms of unique site visits, totaling one billion visits per month compared with DailyMotion's 112 million visits per month.

#### 3\.  Limitation of Videos

![video limit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videolimit-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** One of the best parts about this platform is that it doesn’t come with any upload limit.

**Dailymotion:** Regular users can upload 60 minutes videos of 2 GB limit and the quality of upload is limited to 1280 720p.

**Vimeo:** With a Basic plan, you can upload 500MB/week, with a Plus plan you can upload 5GB/week and with Pro plan you will be able to upload unlimited videos with a per-file limit of 25 GB.

#### 4\.  User Experience

To begin with, both Vimeo and YouTube had a very similar kind of user interface. This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion/month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.

If you are an upcoming entrepreneur who is looking forward to an effective video marketing strategy then you have to come to a decision regarding the portal you want to use for your marketing. As you should know by now [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/) and [Vimeo](https://www.vimeo.com/)are the 3 major players in the field of video marketing. In this article, we are going to give you a comparative analysis of all these video sharing platforms so that you can select the one most suited to your needs.

* [Part 1: Detailed Comparison of Vimeo, YouTube, and DailyMotion](#part1)
* [Part 2: Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo](#part2)

## Compare Vimeo, YouTube, and DailyMotion in 4 Aspects

#### 1\.  Content

![video content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-content.jpg)

Before deciding which video platform to choose, you need to find out about the content in which each of them specializes.

**Youtube:** If your content is more related to entertainment then YouTube is the platform to go for.

 **Vimeo:** Vimeo is a closed community specializing in videos by artists from various genres and is considered to be a more creative platform than YouTube.

**Dailymotion:** Dailymotion has a fair share of both but it resembles the YouTube trend.

#### 2\.  Audience Size and Membership

![audience youtube vimeo dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audience-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** YouTube’s audience is large, with over 1 billion users that watch hundreds of millions of hours of content – each day! Vimeo has a much smaller for their audience, its 170 million viewers, about 42 million are in the United States.

**Vimeo:** Vimeo comes with 4 membership options – the Basic which is available for free and the paid Plus, ($59.95/ year) Pro ($199.00 a year), and Business membership ($599.00 a year). The storage level and support for each membership option vary. The free membership is limited to just 500 MB/week. YouTube and Dailymotion on the other hand are totally free, and Youtube gives unlimited hosting. However YouTube Red is a $9.99 subscription service that will allow you to watch ad-free videos and download them for watching offline.

**Dailymotion:** DailyMotion is the world's second-largest video-sharing website behind YouTube, statistics claimed by both companies show that YouTube has a significant advantage over DailyMotion in terms of unique site visits, totaling one billion visits per month compared with DailyMotion's 112 million visits per month.

#### 3\.  Limitation of Videos

![video limit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videolimit-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** One of the best parts about this platform is that it doesn’t come with any upload limit.

**Dailymotion:** Regular users can upload 60 minutes videos of 2 GB limit and the quality of upload is limited to 1280 720p.

**Vimeo:** With a Basic plan, you can upload 500MB/week, with a Plus plan you can upload 5GB/week and with Pro plan you will be able to upload unlimited videos with a per-file limit of 25 GB.

#### 4\.  User Experience

To begin with, both Vimeo and YouTube had a very similar kind of user interface. This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion/month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.

## Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo
