## Part 2\. YouTube Partner Program: Minimum Requirements to Apply

You can join the YouTube Partner Program once you register for an account on YouTube. Creators who participate in the program must add real value to the platform. In other words, they have established entry requirements.

### YouTube Partner Program Access Requirements Updated in June 2023

YouTube Partner Program eligibility requires at least 500 subscribers. You should keep working on your channel's growth if you don't yet have enough subscribers.

#### Within the last 12 months, achieve 3,000 valid hours of public watch

You could do this in one video, or across all your uploaded videos. This will, however, be based on the 12 months most recently completed.
