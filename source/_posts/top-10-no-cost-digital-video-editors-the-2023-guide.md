Perhaps the strongest argument in favor of Avidemux is its extreme flexibility. This free video editor is available for Windows, iOS, and Linux, and it supports a wide variety of formats and codecs. It is primarily intended for basic cutting, but in the hands of a capable editor, it can perform very well on more demanding projects. Avidemux is also known for its strong scripting capacities, which allow for faster execution of routine tasks and consequently a more streamlined video production process.

## 2\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

As a public project that involved a large number of creative professionals during the design stage, Blender is truly a promising alternative to corporate products. This free creative suite is quite versatile and can be used for tasks such as game creation, video editing, post-production effects, and rendering.

* Primarily intended for 3D animation projects
* Allows great creative freedom on a wide range of tasks
* Customizable and user-friendly interface

## 3\. [Wondershare Filmii](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* Allows keying for green screen effects
* Support for 3D videos

## 5\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/lae/imovie/)

Available for: iOS, Mac OS

Video makers who prefer Apple hardware will be tempted to use iMovie for video editing purposes, and they certainly won’t go wrong. This free software has all it takes to produce a stunning-quality video, including ten cinematic filters. It is even possible to start editing the shots on your phone, then easily transfer them to your MacBook laptop to execute more precise operations and tweak the colors.

* Works on all Apple devices, including smartphones and iPods
* Supports 4K high-resolution videos
* Amazing filters for cinematic quality of your videos
* Easy sharing to social networks or directly to YouTube

The timeline is very easy to manage, while users can take advantage of real-time effects and color correction tools to improve the look of the video.

* Support for work on dual monitors
* Frame rate adjustment

## 7\. [Machete Video Editor Lite](http://www.machetesoft.com/home/about-machete-video-editor-lite.html)

Available for: Windows

As a simplified version of a more comprehensive professional solution, Machete Lite has obvious advantages over other free video editing software products. It supports only two formats (AVI and WMS), so its range of applications is somewhat limited. On the positive side, most video and audio codecs are supported, while the interface is very intuitive. Overall, it’s a good choice for anyone looking to edit simple videos quickly.

* Support for Ultra HD 4K video
* Ability to merge separate video files in the same format
* Access to metadata (file tags)

## 8\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS, Linux

A unique combination of simplicity and power sets Open Shot apart from similar products. Basic cutting and composing are surprisingly simple and quick, and more demanding users will discover a trove of advanced features.

* Easy to learn, easier to use
* Excellent video cutting tools
* Visualization of audio files

## 9\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS, Linux

## 10\. [VideoPad](http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS, Android, Kindle

You don’t have to be a professional editor to take full advantage of Video Pad and its advanced features. This free package packs more than 50 amazing video effects and transitions, so it’s super easy to transform your home video into a visual masterpiece. The editor has no issues with any commonly used video format, and it can take direct input from a camcorder or a webcam. Image stabilization and color correction tools complete the package and guarantee great looking videos.

* Video effects that anyone can use with amazing results
* Drag-and-drop commands for simple editing
* Multi-track audio mixing

## 11\. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

Available for: Windows

Broad compatibility is one of the greatest strengths of this software, as it supports practically any format or codec you can think of. However, it is also notable for non-linear editing capacities, great visual/audio effects, and the simple creation of masks. With the help of some color blending and a few filters, VSDC can be used to produce smooth, attention-grabbing YouTube videos, as well as a range of other video materials with absolute ease, even if you are new to filmmaking.

* Non-linear sequencing of shots
* Precise object positioning and/or masking
* Simple exporting of finished videos to social networks

## 12\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

Special effects and green screen effects are straightforward to use with an online solution that doesn’t require any downloads or software installation.

* Cloud-based solution with hosted storage
* Intuitive interface that allows easy access to all features
* Support for high-resolution 4K video files

## 13\. Windows Movie Maker

Available for: Windows

Everyone knows about this editor since it’s been around for a long time. Microsoft stopped releasing new versions, but Windows Movie Maker remains relevant in 2018\. It’s definitely not the most advanced product in the market and it is best suited for simple projects and beginner-level users. However, its cutting and editing tools are pretty solid, while transitions, animations, and visual effects are quite simple to pull off.

* Already included on many Windows-based computers
* Sourcing footage from a computer or camera
* Direct sharing to YouTube and other networks

## Are you ready for something better?

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

As you can see, there is no shortage of free video editing software suites. However, free software does tend to be either very limited, or very specifically targeted (i.e. Blender is specifically for animators). Wondershare's [**Filmora** **Video Editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker. You can even try all the features for free, for as long as you like! Exports from the free trial do have a watermark, though.

What free video editing software have you tried?

As you can see, there is no shortage of free video editing software suites. However, free software does tend to be either very limited, or very specifically targeted (i.e. Blender is specifically for animators). Wondershare's [**Filmora** **Video Editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker. You can even try all the features for free, for as long as you like! Exports from the free trial do have a watermark, though.
