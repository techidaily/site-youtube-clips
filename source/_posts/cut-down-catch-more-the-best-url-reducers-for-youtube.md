<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube studio content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-creator-studio-unlocking-the-power-of-your-channel-4.JPG)

Click on the Content tab on the dashboard. Manage your content by editing or just reviewing the performance of each video. You can also create playlists linked to the videos to choose watch time.

##### Step 4Monitoring Channel Performance

![youtube studio analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-creator-studio-unlocking-the-power-of-your-channel-5.JPG)

The YouTube Creator Studio Analytics provides a summary of your video metrics and reports. This will help you figure out what is working. The analytics also point out what needs to be improved to gain more views. Be sure to check views and watch time to get an accurate picture of the channel’s performance.

##### Step 5Review Your Studio Monetization Tab

![youtube studio earn](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-creator-studio-unlocking-the-power-of-your-channel-6.JPG)

The monetization tab shows the monetization status of your channel. On the left side of the dashboard, click Earn to access this feature. After being accepted to the YPP, you can make money from advertising revenue, merch shelf, channel membership, and the fan-funded program. Before monetization, this page shows how far you are to meet the eligibility criteria.

### **Importance of Verifying the YouTube Channel**

After uploading your videos to YouTube Creator Studio, you need to optimize each for monetization. This ensures that the algorithm works in your favor. It is also important to create an AdSense Account and link it to your channel. This will:

* Increase your level of credibility because a verified YouTube channel is seen as more trustworthy by viewers
* Protect you and your channel from impersonation by preventing other users from creating fake accounts under your name.
* Unlock additional features such as the ability to lie stream in HD and customer the channel layout.

Linking your AdSense to the Account is also a crucial step towards getting paid for your creation on YouTube. It ensures that your earnings get to you. After joining the YPP, you are allowed to change your linked AdSense account if you already have one. You can also monetize more than one channel using the same AdSense account, and keep track of your earnings.
