## What Is Valorant?

Valorant is a free-to-play tactical first-person shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games. The game was released in June 2020 and has quickly gained popularity due to its high-stakes, team-based gameplay and unique characters.

In Valorant, players choose from a roster of agents, each with their abilities and playstyle, and compete in 5v5 objective-based matches. The game has a variety of game modes, including the popular "Spike Rush" mode, which features a shorter round time and special abilities for all players. Valorant is available on Microsoft Windows and will soon be available on other platforms.

### Option 3: Editing URL

This is among the least known method of creating a video loop. It involves editing the video URL of YouTube to replay. URL is usually divided in to different sections. This is the simplest option as involves only deleting the hypertext transfer protocol (https) and the World Wide Web (www) and inserting the word “repeat” immediately after “Youtube”.

This is how to do it:

**Step 1:** Search for the video to set on replay.

In our case, let’s choose - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc>

**Step 2:** Delete the first part “**<https://www.**”> in the address bar.

The remaining sections will be- youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc

**Step 3:** After “Youtube” and before “.com” write “repeat”.

So it looks like this “youtube**repeat**.com/watch/?v=xo1VInw-SKc” in your address bar.

**Step 4:** Click to play and your video will start playing in a loop in the ListenOnRepeat app.

This is among the least known method of creating a video loop. It involves editing the video URL of YouTube to replay. URL is usually divided in to different sections.

This is how to do it:

**Step 1:** Search for the video to set on replay.

In our case, let’s choose - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc>

**Step 2:** Delete the first part “**<https://www.**”> in the address bar.

The remaining sections will be- youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc

**Step 3:** After “Youtube” and before “.com” write “repeat”.

So it looks like this “youtube**repeat**.com/watch/?v=xo1VInw-SKc” in your address bar.

**Step 4:** Click to play and your video will start playing in a loop in the ListenOnRepeat app.
