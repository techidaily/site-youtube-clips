It provides powerful editing tools, real-time feedback on how your films are performing, and one-click posting from your PC or smartphone. YouTube Studio provides several features:

#### 1\. Manages Multiple Channels

YouTube Studio makes managing a couple of channels a lot easier. You can see all of your channels on one screen and switch from one to the other without difficulty. Simply select Manage Channels from the account icon in the top right corner. When you have a lot of money owing to you, you can modify it.

#### 2\. Get Real-Time Data On Your Channels

It's critical to monitor where your YouTube channel is at all times as a YouTube content creator. If you want to access your YouTube channel analytics and use all of the other equipment and features in the app, go to the analytics section of the menu.
