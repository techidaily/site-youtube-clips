### 1.Sasha Evdakov: [Tradersfly](https://www.youtube.com/c/tradersflyofficial)

This is one of the best Youtube channels for stock market beginners. Sasha Evdakov is a great teacher and can introduce the hardest topics to everyone, regarding their level of knowledge in the stock market.

By going through his first videos, you'll get a general idea of the basics of how to approach the stock market in 2022\. He advocates more long-term investments and because he's located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He's very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members. Definitely a good start if you want to dig more into stocks. He started his channel back in 2021 and releases videos once a week.

### 2.[Investors Underground](https://www.youtube.com/user/investorsunderground)

Investors Underground is a 145K subscriber stock market channel based in the U.S. A great plus of this channel is its live chat and great instructional videos. It was created by two investors back in May of 2013\. Besides having a strong following, in this channel, you can also connect with other traders and exchange information and tips on what stocks might be good to hold for the long term or others that might be better to sell. In this channel, you can also have daily recaps so you can be on top of all the major movements during the day and not miss anything. Investors Underground has many lessons from beginners to more advanced traders so it is recommended for all types of investors. You can also follow them on other social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram to have constant updates throughout your day.

### 3.[Young And Investing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCczMw5XzxxVks7sNaC-QxwQ)

This channel releases two videos every quarter, which means these are usually longer and encompass more information than the channels that release videos every week. But in general, these have more accurate information because the creators have more time to analyze all the data. Young And Investing are based in Belgium, so the channel is more focused on European stocks. Besides the normal stocks, this channel also offers cryptocurrency reviews, tutorials, and portfolios. With more than 7 million views since the creation of the channel in April 2017, Young And Investing have one of the biggest following in this area. If you have any doubt you can contact directly the creator, Quinten through his personal email.

### 4.[High Altitude Investing](https://www.youtube.com/c/HighAltitudeInvesting)

With almost 2 million views and 27 thousand subscribers, High Altitude Investing is one of the best bitcoin and altcoin channels on youtube when it comes to investing. This is not a conventional stock market channel and it aims to more advanced traders and investors. Joining Youtube in February 2016, High Altitude Investing is certainly a great choice if you want to get more involved in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
