If you just want to slow down parts of the video, go back to the main editing tab, clip it from the original video using the slicing tool and add the slow-motion effect to that clip only. You can then arrange the different clips you have in the editor to create your final video.

**Step 3:** Tick the option "Preview effects side-by-side" with original video and then you can see how the original video plays compared to the one you've slowed down. If you're happy with the result, hit "Done" to save the settings.
