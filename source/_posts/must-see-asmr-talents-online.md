![Wondershare Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png)

## What Is a YouTube Video Background?

A **YouTube video background** is a simple image or video that sits in place at the back of your videos. It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.

Even something as small as your **YouTube video thumbnail background** can strongly impact your results.

Obviously, choosing the right **custom YouTube background** is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.

## Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?

There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.

The main reasons include:

* Creates a meaningful connection;
* Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;
* Builds a better brand;
* Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.

So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal **YouTube video background download**.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

##### Step 4

Select your favorite background clip and drag it down to the Timeline.

That’s it! You won’t believe how many video clips you can use, all of which are extremely high-quality. As a result, you’ll have a professional video for free.

Now, if you want, you can freely edit these backgrounds as you wish. You can mess around with them as much as you want, use various tools to edit, and make the perfect result.

And don’t worry, if you mess up the background and don’t know how to restore it, just delete it from the timeline and drag it again from the Stock Media tab. It will be as good as new.

Once you’re done, simply export it and you’re done.

## Integrating Your Background Into Videos

Finally, once you have the perfect YouTube studio background, it’s time to glue it to your video and upload this masterpiece.

In order to do this, you will need to use a video editing platform once again. This is not optional as there is no other way to merge these clips.

Luckily, you now have Filmora downloaded and can easily make it happen.

So, here’s how to combine everything.

##### Step 1

Start up a New Project in Filmora.
