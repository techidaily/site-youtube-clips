The great news is that there are so many advanced audio recording software tools that allow users to record audios directly from YouTube videos.

Sometimes, we are interested to play our favorite music during a long hour journey, but the missing internet connectivity does not allow us to stream it online. In such a situation also, you can get your free music easily on your iPad, iPhone, or any handheld device and it can be later burnt into CD as well. Now you might be interested to know how all this can happen without the “Record Audio” button on YouTube. Don’t worry! Below we have highlighted three simple methods to do this task:
