## 10\. THE LADY VANISHES

The Lady Vanishes is both comically dated and a by-the-numbers primer on constructing a near-perfect thriller. Alfred Hitchcock directed the film, which was released in 1938\. Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, and Paul Lukas are among the stars. The IMDb rating is 7.8/10.

#### The plot of the movie

Here's a film's plot. An avalanche delays a party of travelers on a train bound for England. Young Iris (Margaret Lockwood) befriends elderly Miss Froy while holed up in a hotel in a fictitious European country (Dame May Whitty). When the train resumes, Iris falls unconscious and awakens to find the older woman has vanished. When the other passengers ominously deny Miss Froy's existence, Iris goes on to investigate with another traveler (Michael Redgrave), and romantic sparks fly between the two sleuths.

## Edit your YouTube video with Filmora

Furthermore, Filmora is excellent for editing short videos and making short video advertisements. When you require more functionality than the original Windows Movie Maker, Filmora is a perfect choice. However, the procedure of importing (paying) templates from the library is time-consuming, and the software alternates between local and online installation.

Wondershare Filmora's primary features include 4K editing support, GIF compatibility, noise removal, color tuning, a powerful text editor, an audio mixer, video stabilization, scene identification, and audio equalization. Users can edit and export videos with a resolution of up to 4K, thanks to the 4K editing support function.
