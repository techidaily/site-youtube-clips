## How to increase your YouTube subscribers faster

1. **Long videos should be published.**  
Research shows that the possibility of longer videos ranking high in search engines is greater than shorter ones. Aim for your video to rank high in YouTube's search engine. The best way is to have longer videos that show detailed information to viewers.
2. **Optimize watch time.**  
YouTube also factors in the watch time, both for SEO results and promotional purposes. Videos with a high watch time are likely to be promoted on the YouTube homepage. You can use lots of patterns interrupts to keep people watching or include graphics to help them focus more.
3. **Embed your videos into blog posts.**  
Blogs are a great way to tell your viewers what your product brings to the table. If you can get someone to read your post, then it shows they like your stuff. So, embed your video and let them learn via detailed steps, and they'll probably subscribe to your channel.
4. **Add a brand watermark.**  
A branding watermark helps viewers subscribe to your channel right inside the video. You can use a link that looks like a "YT subscribe" button. Also, make it large enough to be visible at a glance.
5. **Promote videos on the end screen**.  
Remember that the more someone watches your videos, the higher the chances of them subscribing to your channel. So, do the trick and promote your next video on the end screen of the current video. This will make a viewer watch more and more of your videos, and probably subscribe to your channel.
6. **Respond to every comment.**  
Show that you care. And note that every comment or review matters a lot to your brand. So, strive to respond to every comment that a viewer leaves on your page.
7. **Give thought to the channel description.**  
Here is where some YouTube channels miss it all. The description should be engaging and inviting. That’s the only way to lure viewers to hit that subscribe button. Let the description tell viewers what the channel is about and give other important information.
8. **Video quality**  
Your video is your voice when it comes to promoting your channel. Ensure you give people quality videos with a piece of detailed advice that works for them. Also, remember to upload quality videos regularly to boost the growth of your channel. A good video should have high resolution, among other good qualities.
