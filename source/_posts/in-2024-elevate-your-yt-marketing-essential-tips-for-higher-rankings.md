## How Does YouTube SEO Work?

YouTube SEO is an excellent way to ensure your videos get more views. The main goal of YouTube SEO is to rank high for specific keywords in search engines. As such, it is crucial to know how YouTube SEO works if you want to boost the ranking of your videos.

Whether you are a blogger, market researcher, or video marketer, you need YouTube SEO to generate traffic to your videos. YouTube SEO involves optimizing your videos, channel, descriptions, metadata, and playlists. You can optimize videos for search within and outside YouTube.

Because search engine bots can't watch YouTube videos, they depend on accompanying text data when indexing them. So you must also know how to harness the power of text in your video, which can positively impact SEO, viewership, engagement, and user experience.

## 11 Useful YouTube SEO Tips to Help Boost Your Video Ranking

Want to drive more traffic and increase your video views? Here are eleven YouTube SEO tips that will help you to boost your video ranking.

#### 1\. Conduct Keyword Research First

![youtube seo tips - conduct keywords reseaerch first](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-1.png)

When it comes to YouTube SEO, keywords are crucial. YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.

For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.

#### 2\. Use a Good Video Title

![youtube seo tips - video title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-2.png)

The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it's what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you'll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.

#### 3\. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website

Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.

#### 4\. Add Tags To The Video Description

![youtube seo tips - add tags to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-3.png)

When you upload your video, remember to add tags to the "About" section of the page. You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.

When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.

#### 5\. Edit The Filename

![youtube seo tips - edit the file name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-4.png)

The filename of your video, or the "video URL," can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.

#### 6\. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions

![youtube seo tips - add subtitles and closed captions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-5.png)

Adding subtitles and closed captions to your videos is also a good idea, especially if you want the video's ranking and viewership to improve. Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.

#### 7\. Select Video Category

![youtube seo tips - select video category](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png)

When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube's algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.

#### 8\. Use a Compelling Thumbnail

![youtube seo tips - use compelling thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-7.png)

Make sure you use [the right YouTube video thumbnail image](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as this makes a big difference in the click-through rate. You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.

Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.

Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.

#### 9\. Make High-Quality Longer

Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.

#### 11\. Add End Screens and YouTube Cards

![youtube seo tips - add end screens and youtube cards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-8.png)

YouTube cards encourage viewers to take action during your video. The cards show up in the top right corner of your videos; users can click on and explore more. Using YouTube cards is an excellent way to boost your ranking. YouTube allows you to add a maximum of five cards to each video.

## Part 3: Using Comments Search for YouTube Extension

If you are looking for an easy method to search YouTube comments, you can use the Comments Search for YouTube extension. Google Chrome supports this extension that allows you to search comments on YouTube without leaving the website.

How can you use this extension to search YouTube comments? Here is a simple step-by-step tutorial.

1. First, you need to download the extension from[Github](https://github.com/lettapp/ytcs/archive/master.zip). Then, locate the file on your computer and unzip it.
2. Next, you need to install it in the browser. Open your Chrome browser, and from the top right corner, click on the three vertical dots. You will find the Settings option towards the end of the drop-down menu, and then click on it.
3. When the Settings page opens, select Extensions from the panel on the left side of the webpage. This will take you to a new tab.
4. On the top right corner of the page, there will be a toggle switch called Developer Mode. Turn it on if it is off.
5. Once the Developer Mode is on, you will see three options now. Click on Load unpacked. Locate the downloaded extension file and click on it. Finally, disable Developer Mode.

When you complete these steps, you click on the extension icon to search comments on YouTube. You can also do this by using the combination ‘Ctrl + S’ on the target YouTube page. The extension also includes some advanced features like –

**1\. Global Mode**

In this mode, you can type ‘global: your parameter’ to search all comments on the channel that fit your parameter.

**2\. Advanced Mode**

This mode allows you to enter special commands to carry out an advanced search. Some including typing –

1. ‘:’ to look for comments with timestamps
2. ‘:all’ to see all comments
3. ‘:creator’ to get comments made by the creator

## Part 5: How to Find Out Who Posts the Most Comments on Your YouTube Videos?

If you are a creator on YouTube, the comments section becomes very important. Subscribers comment words of praise, encouragement, and feedback which help you grow. You may want to keep track of your most loyal followers. The best way to know that is by knowing who comments most on your videos.

Here is how you can figure out who is your channel super fan on the YouTube mobile app.

1. Open YouTube app on your mobile device, and then sign in.
2. From your public videos, select one from where you want to gather insights about your subscribers. Click on the video and scroll down to see the comments section.
3. Choose a comment by someone whose engagement with your channel you want to check.
4. On the left side of the comment, you will see the icon of the person’s channel. Click on it and you will see a pop-up menu with insights about the person. Here, you can learn about the number of comments they have posted on your channel.

This feature is helpful as it lists more than the number of comments made by someone. You can see insights like when they joined YouTube, how many subscribers they have, when someone subscribed to your channel, how many comments anyone posted on your videos, and how many responses they got from you. You can even see glimpses of all their comments. Clicking on them will take you to the whole conversation.

You can also see their channel’s banner from this section, which should tell you their channel’s niche.

**Final Thoughts**

YouTube is a global platform to share helpful and entertaining videos. The comments section of each video contains informative comments, feedback, and essential timestamps. Searching YouTube comments can help someone understand if the video is valuable or not. For many creators, the comments become the only way to engage with their supporters and create a tight-knit community.

Find feedback or questions. Report offensive comments. If you are a regular YouTube user, use our tips and tricks to search comments quickly and grow your channel.
