## Expert Tips: Unleashing Your Potential in YouTube Ads

While there are a lot of ways you could advertise your business online, YouTube video ads are quickly becoming the most popular advertising solution. This is because more and more people choose to watch videos than any other form of video.

![youtube ad creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-ad-creator.jpg)

But to make sure that you are putting your best foot forward when it comes to video ads, you need to invest in a YouTube ad creator that is easy to use and effective. Here, we will be looking at the best YouTube video creators that you can use.

## Why Use YouTube Video Ads

Before we look at some of the tools you can use to create YouTube video ads, it is important to mention some of the reasons why you may want to choose YouTube ads over other solutions. YouTube ads when compared to PPC are relatively cheaper and you also choose how much you are willing to pay when a user clicks on the ads. This makes it unlikely that you could spend more than you intended to.

YouTube ads are also more targeted than any other form of advertising. You have a lot of options when choosing who you want to target including metrics such as demographics, topics, similar audiences, customer matches, life events, and more.

Since the ad is a video, it generates far more engagement than a text ad on any other platform. Even though it is an ad, the video is still a great way for your brand to connect with potential audiences.

## Types of Video Ads for YouTube

The following are the different types of YouTube ads that you can create;

****Video Discovery**

Video discover ads appear on the search page results and are usually composed of a thumbnail image and a few lines of text. They also have a very recognizable “Ad” in the box to let all users know that this is sponsored content.

****In-Stream Ads**

In-stream video ads can be skippable or non-skippable. Skippable in-stream video ads will often play for a minimum of 5 seconds before allowing the user to skip to the video content. Non-skippable in-stream video ads do not have the “skip” button and the user has to watch the video to the end.

****Pre-roll Ads**

A pre-roll ad is just an in-stream ad that is not skippable. It doesn’t give the user the option of skipping the app and they have to watch the entire ad before they can watch the video. The pre-roll video ad is usually 15 to 60 seconds long.

****Bumper Ads**

Bumper ads are tiny non-skippable 6-second ads that will play right before the video content loads. They can be an ideal way to promote an event or a new brand. Since they are only 6 seconds long, they can be very easy to make.

* Choose the type of ad you would like to create wisely. Learn the different types of YouTube ads and select one based on your brand, advertising budget, and projected reach.
* Use the YouTube targeting options to give your ads the best chance at success. Ensure that you are choosing the right targets to avoid spending money on targets that will not engage with your ad.
* You may also want to use your videos in a remarketing campaign. Remarketing targets the same audience that you targeted before, increasing your chances of getting more engagement.
* When creating the ad, ensure that the content in the ad is compelling and feels natural. Even though the audience will be watching sponsored content it should feel just like any other video.
* You can also drive more engagement by adding interactive elements to the video. These can be calls-to-action, auto-end screens, and cards to showcase your products.
