## Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular

The list of subscribers to your channel offered by YouTube's Creator Studio can be used for a variety of different purposes. You can compare your channel to channels with a similar number of subscribers, or you can find out how many users that have subscribed to your channel have around the same (or even more) subscribers than you do. If you are thinking about [creating a collab video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-collab-videos-and-grow-your-channel-206.html), your list of subscribers can be a great source of potential partners.

So in order to see which of your subscribers are the most popular, you simply need to change the settings in the Subscribers panel from most recent to most popular.

## Part 3: How to See Other People’s Subscribers

Seeing the list of subscribers on other people's channels is no longer possible on YouTube, even though it was a common feature in the past.

What you can do is select one of your subscribers from the subscriber list on your channel, and go to their channel and then click on the About option that will show you the number of subscribers and the total number of views to the channel (or [use one of these tools to see the sub count of any channel in real-time](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Unfortunately, YouTube channel owners can no longer browse through other people's subscribers and for that reason, their interactions with potential subscribers are somewhat limited.

If you want to get more subscribers, you must consider your channel's branding. Want to improve your branding? [Click here to see examples from popular channels that have nailed their brand.](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-brand-your-youtube-channel-to-get-more-subscribers-411.html)
