Ever think about how to get a YouTube video trending? It can come down to picking a topic that's trending.

A trending topic is a subject which a lot of people are currently interested in. If you learn how to tap into what‚Äôs popular and cover it in creative and innovative ways then that will help your channel grow more quickly. You‚Äôll get more views, more subscribers, and higher search rankings by following these simple tips.

1. **[Think of 'Trending' as Relevant](#relevant)**
2. **[Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche](#niche)**
3. **[Aim for Number 1](#aim)**
4. **[Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video](#viral)**
5. **[The Subscriber Snowball Effect](#snowball)**

[![guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide-to-grow-youtube-subscribers-download-btn.png)](https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers?utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fcampaign=get%5Fsubs%5Fevergreen&utm%5Fcontent=blog%202)

## **1\. Think of ‚ÄòTrending‚Äô as Relevant**

Instead of thinking of a trending video as a video that everyone is doing, think of it as a subject that is relevant to a lot of people. You want to cover topics that a lot of people care about.

A lot of YouTubers see huge channels have a lot of success posting videos that are very focused on the personal life of the creator (i.e. ‚ÄòI had the WORST day‚Äô) or which have very vague or sensational titles (i.e. ‚ÄòThe horse knows what it did‚Äô) and decide that those are the kinds of videos they want to do too. However, the only reason large channels are able to be successful with these kinds of videos and titles is that they are already big. These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.

As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting. The content might be good, but it won‚Äôt help you grow.

## **2\. Find Trending Topics Within Your Niche**

**![find your niche](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/niche-find-your-niche.jpg)**

Taking on trending topics shouldn‚Äôt mean taking on topics you aren‚Äôt actually interested in or don‚Äôt care about. Every genre on YouTube has its own trends, and you will often know about them just by virtue of watching other channels in your genre and talking to people who are interested in the same things as you. For example, if you‚Äôre a Gamer and your friends are also Gamers then you probably already know what Gamers are currently interested in.

If you do need help determining trends, here are 2 ways to do it:

1. Visit 3 of the most popular channels in your genre (i.e. gaming, beauty, or prank) and see if there‚Äôs any overlap in the themes of their most recent videos.
2. Go to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.ca/trends/) and look at the categories most relevant to your genre. [To learn how to use Google Trends](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## **3\. Aim for Number 1**

**![think-in-divergent-way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-in-divergent-way.jpg)**

Being trendy doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be original. If you know what‚Äôs popular in your genre then that will enable you to ask yourself ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs on-trend, but not being covered yet?‚Äô.

For example, if you know that relationship videos ‚Äì topics like ‚Äòhow do you know a guy likes you?‚Äô ‚Äì are doing well then you can think about what other aspects of dating people might be interested in that don‚Äôt have many videos on them yet. If you‚Äôre one of the first to tackle something that‚Äôs on-trend you have a much better chance of getting that number 1 search engine ranking, and higher ranked videos always get more views.

## **4\. Success Doesn't Mean Making a Viral Video**

**![viral-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viral-video.png)**

There‚Äôs a common misconception that in order to grow your channel you need to make your videos go viral. The truth is that having one or two viral videos probably won‚Äôt help you much. People don‚Äôt subscribe to one video, they subscribe for consistently good content.

It‚Äôs much better to have 10 videos on a popular topic that are doing alright than it is to have that one big viral hit. Those 10 videos will consistently bring in new viewers to your channel who are more likely to subscribe because they can see you have other content they‚Äôre interested in.

## **5\. The Subscriber Snowball Effect**

**![snowball-effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snowball-effect.jpg)**

When you make multiple videos around a trending topic, they‚Äôre more likely to come up as ‚Äòrelated‚Äô to each other than if you only cover the topic in one video. If someone enjoys one of your videos on that topic and can see there‚Äôs another right there in the related videos, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll click on it.

This gets you more views on multiple videos, and more subscribers because it builds the expectation that you‚Äôre going to continue to keep covering relevant topics. Having viewers click from video to video on your channel also increases your watch time, which YouTube‚Äôs algorithm takes as a sign that they should rank your videos higher in search results (getting you even more views).
