Here, we will be looking at some of the best tools that you can use to add captions to your video.

## Best Video Caption Makers

The following are the top video caption makers that you can choose from;

### YouTube Automatic Caption

If you already have your own YouTube channel, you can use the built-in speech recognition feature to generate accurate captions for your video. This feature can generate captions in a number of languages including English, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Korean, French, Italian, and Dutch which is more than some of the premium caption generators in the market.

The main reason most people choose this solution is that it is fairly simple to use. You don’t have to do much; just upload the video and the automatic caption generator will create the captions you need.

**_Key Features_**

* It is easy to use and freely accessible
* You can use it to generate captions in a number of different languages
* It is very accurate
* You can use it to generate transcripts for the video

### Kapwing Auto-Subtitle Maker

Kapwing is an online solution that will generate subtitles and captions for most videos. But it does limit the size of the video that it can generate subtitles on to about 500 MB. There is a free version of the program that although limited in functionality will not add a watermark to the generated captions file. But free users can only get captions for up to 7 minutes of video, making it a less ideal solution when you have a longer video.

**_Key Features_**

* You can generate captions and subtitles for free
* It is accessible online and you don’t have to install software on your computer to get the captions
* It has a very simple user interface, making the caption generation process quick and easy
* In addition to generating subtitles and captions, you can edit existing files.

### Adobe Premiere Pro CC

You may know Adobe Premiere as one of the most popular video editing programs on the market, but most people are unaware that it can also be used to generate captions for the video. This tool can be very useful in the creation of high-quality videos and you can generate an accurate caption or subtitle for the video as well.

But Adobe Premiere is not an easy solution to use for both video editing and adding captions, particularly for beginner users. But it is certainly one of the best ways to create and edit videos on your computer.

**_Key Features_**

* Even though the interface is not easy to use, it is clear and flexible
* You have numerous options to add the captions including font style and color
* The captions that you add using this tool will be very accurate

While editing the subtitle file is easy, creating a caption file using Amara can be a lengthy process since you would have to type in the text.

**_Key Features_**

* It can be used to edit caption and subtitles files easily
* The user interface is pleasant and easy to use
* It is completely free

### Aegisubs

Aegisubs is another tool that you can use to create subtitles for your video. But we must warn you right off the bat that this tool is not very user-friendly and you may find that you will spend a lot of time trying to generate subtitles for your video. But it is a free solution and widely accessible on most platforms.

**_Key Features_**

* It can be used to create subtitles and captions in different languages
* It supports numerous video and audio formats
* It has a simple user interface that is easy to navigate
* It doesn’t have speech recognition and you’ll have to enter all the text manually
