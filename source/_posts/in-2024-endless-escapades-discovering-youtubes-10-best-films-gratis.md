Along with viral stars and adorable animal montages, genuine, 100 percent free (and good) movies are available.

I‚Äôve been on YouTube for two years now and it‚Äôs no secret that I‚Äôve had my challenges balancing it with my full-time job ‚Äî and avoiding YouTube burnout. I‚Äôm a Social Worker, which means I‚Äôm always juggling my time between conducting home visits, returning phone calls and emails, and round-the-clock documentation on my clients. YouTube can be a great source of passive income, but it takes time before you can [make money on YouTube](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html).

I‚Äôve had to put a lot of effort into staying consistent with my YouTube channel. Through trial and error, I‚Äôve learned some things that have worked tremendously, while others have been epic fails.

So, to save you and your viewers some of the same struggles, here are 5 tips I recommend for keeping your channel running successfully and having work-life balance!

[1\. Don't force yourself to post on specific days](#specificdays)

[2\. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner](#notebook)

[3\. Check the weather forecast in advance](#weather)

[4\. Create 3-5 videos in advance](#createvideos)

[5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)](#createaudio)

## 1. Don‚Äôt force yourself to post on specific days

I know what you‚Äôre thinking - ‚ÄúWhat?! That‚Äôs insane.‚Äù The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn‚Äôt work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn‚Äôt stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it‚Äôs best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that‚Äôs my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.

## 2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner

A notebook planner is essential for keeping my life organized and on track. When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos ‚Äì this didn‚Äôt work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.

## 3. Check the weather forecast in advance

When starting a YouTube channel, many YouTubers like myself don‚Äôt have the money to afford all the fancy lighting you see other creators using. [I use natural light](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which means I have to make sure it‚Äôs going to be a sunny day or at least bright enough for my videos to be clear. I check the forecast for the week on Sunday evenings so I can plan out my best days to film, this keeps my video shooting schedule productive.

## 4. Create 3-5 videos in advance

This week I am on PTO (paid time off) which has given me a lot more time to film videos I can post for next month. Life happens and it can set you back on filming. If you happen to get a major break in your workweek, use the opportunity to film a bunch of videos, edit them, and have them waiting in your pocket. I filmed three videos in one day ‚Äì I planned and set-up the night before, which made filming much smoother. Trust me, this tip works wonders!

## 5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)

In the event that life gets too crazy, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to do just audio. Many of us are always on the go which means it‚Äôs the perfect time to listen to great advice while driving to work, waiting on the bus, or working at the gym. Someone out there would love to hear your advice. I started to do this with my Tea Time Talk Audios and the response was great.

I hope these tips can help you on your journey with YouTube while still working a full-time job.

This week I am on PTO (paid time off) which has given me a lot more time to film videos I can post for next month. Life happens and it can set you back on filming. If you happen to get a major break in your workweek, use the opportunity to film a bunch of videos, edit them, and have them waiting in your pocket. I filmed three videos in one day ‚Äì I planned and set-up the night before, which made filming much smoother. Trust me, this tip works wonders!

## 5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)

In the event that life gets too crazy, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to do just audio. Many of us are always on the go which means it‚Äôs the perfect time to listen to great advice while driving to work, waiting on the bus, or working at the gym. Someone out there would love to hear your advice. I started to do this with my Tea Time Talk Audios and the response was great.

I hope these tips can help you on your journey with YouTube while still working a full-time job.

I‚Äôve been on YouTube for two years now and it‚Äôs no secret that I‚Äôve had my challenges balancing it with my full-time job ‚Äî and avoiding YouTube burnout. I‚Äôm a Social Worker, which means I‚Äôm always juggling my time between conducting home visits, returning phone calls and emails, and round-the-clock documentation on my clients. YouTube can be a great source of passive income, but it takes time before you can [make money on YouTube](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html).

I‚Äôve had to put a lot of effort into staying consistent with my YouTube channel. Through trial and error, I‚Äôve learned some things that have worked tremendously, while others have been epic fails.

So, to save you and your viewers some of the same struggles, here are 5 tips I recommend for keeping your channel running successfully and having work-life balance!

[1\. Don't force yourself to post on specific days](#specificdays)

[2\. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner](#notebook)

[3\. Check the weather forecast in advance](#weather)

[4\. Create 3-5 videos in advance](#createvideos)

[5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)](#createaudio)

## 1. Don‚Äôt force yourself to post on specific days

I know what you‚Äôre thinking - ‚ÄúWhat?! That‚Äôs insane.‚Äù The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn‚Äôt work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn‚Äôt stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it‚Äôs best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that‚Äôs my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.

## 2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner

A notebook planner is essential for keeping my life organized and on track. When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos ‚Äì this didn‚Äôt work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.

## 3. Check the weather forecast in advance

When starting a YouTube channel, many YouTubers like myself don‚Äôt have the money to afford all the fancy lighting you see other creators using. [I use natural light](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which means I have to make sure it‚Äôs going to be a sunny day or at least bright enough for my videos to be clear. I check the forecast for the week on Sunday evenings so I can plan out my best days to film, this keeps my video shooting schedule productive.
