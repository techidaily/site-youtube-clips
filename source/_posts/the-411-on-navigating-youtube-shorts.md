## Part 1\. Steps on Editing YouTube Videos Using iMovie

To edit a video for YouTube with iMovie, you can follow these steps.

### Step 1: Import Video Clips into iMovie

If you have recorded the video clips with the use of a videocam, then connect the camera to the Mac and open the app. You can import the videos by manually selecting the clips that will be part of the YouTube video.

**Note:** If you want to import videos that you have already published on your YouTube channel, then you can download them from the channel, and save them as MP4\. However, if the videos were uploaded by other users, then you need to use a video converter, this article will let you know the [8 best video converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to convert video to MP4.

### Step 2: Edit the Video Clips

Once you have all the clips that you need, the next step is to edit YouTube videos in iMovie. When you import the clips, you have created an Event in the app. If you want to include a clip in your final video, just drag the file to the project browser, where you can edit the video.

### Step 3: Enhance the Video

iMovie allows you to add text to any part of the video, whether it is a title screen at the start, credits at the end, and everything in between. Try to enhance the video until you think it is ready to be uploaded to YouTube.

* **Add YouTube title** **:** If you want to add a title for YouTube Video, all you need to do is click **Title** in the toolbar, and then highlight **My Movie** on the left. From here, enter the title you like.
* **Organize videos** **:** You also can rearrange video clips in the timeline. Just drag the video on the timeline to wherever you want.
* **Add transitions** **:** If you have more than one video clip, you definitely need transitions between them. Click the **Transitions** tab, and then select one transition you like. In the end, drag it to stop between two clips.

### Step 4: Export and Upload the Video to YouTube

iMovie is the built-in video editor that allows you to combine several video clips. It is available for both Mac and iOS devices. This app was first released in 1999 when it came with the iMac DV model.

With the use of the iMovie, you are able to create movies that include sound effects, menus, transitions, titles, themes, and music, just to name a few. The resulting movie can be saved onto physical media or as a file on the hard drive.

If you are a Mac user, then you can easily edit YouTube videos in iMovie. All you need to do is to follow the simple steps below. In this article, you will learn how to import videos, organize videos, add YouTube titles and add transitions.

## Part 1\. Steps on Editing YouTube Videos Using iMovie

To edit a video for YouTube with iMovie, you can follow these steps.

### Step 1: Import Video Clips into iMovie

If you have recorded the video clips with the use of a videocam, then connect the camera to the Mac and open the app. You can import the videos by manually selecting the clips that will be part of the YouTube video.

**Note:** If you want to import videos that you have already published on your YouTube channel, then you can download them from the channel, and save them as MP4\. However, if the videos were uploaded by other users, then you need to use a video converter, this article will let you know the [8 best video converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to convert video to MP4.

### Step 2: Edit the Video Clips

Once you have all the clips that you need, the next step is to edit YouTube videos in iMovie. When you import the clips, you have created an Event in the app. If you want to include a clip in your final video, just drag the file to the project browser, where you can edit the video.

![edit video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/transitions-imovie.jpg)

You can also add videos from other Events into the current project. You can select the parts of the video by dragging across the video from the chosen start to stop points. Edit the video until you are satisfied with the results.

### Step 3: Enhance the Video

Once you have edited the video, you can then add background music, themes, sound effects, onscreen text, transitions between clips, and photos. **The best thing about iMovie is that it comes with a sound effects library.** It also allows you to upload audio from your iTunes library, iLife, and GarageBand.

iMovie allows you to add text to any part of the video, whether it is a title screen at the start, credits at the end, and everything in between. Try to enhance the video until you think it is ready to be uploaded to YouTube.

* **Add YouTube title** **:** If you want to add a title for YouTube Video, all you need to do is click **Title** in the toolbar, and then highlight **My Movie** on the left. From here, enter the title you like.
* **Organize videos** **:** You also can rearrange video clips in the timeline. Just drag the video on the timeline to wherever you want.
* **Add transitions** **:** If you have more than one video clip, you definitely need transitions between them. Click the **Transitions** tab, and then select one transition you like. In the end, drag it to stop between two clips.

### Step 4: Export and Upload the Video to YouTube

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-export-to-file.jpg)

When you edit YouTube videos in iMovie, you have the option to export the video straight to the video streaming website. All you need to do is to click on the **Share** button found at the top of the screen. Then select **YouTube**. Add your YouTube account in iMovie by entering your username and password. Then you choose a title, description, and tags for the video.

You can choose the resolution and size of the video that includes HD 720p and HD 1080p, mobile, medium, and large. Click on **Publish** to upload the video to YouTube. Uploading the video will take several minutes to a couple of hours, depending on the resolution and size of the video.
