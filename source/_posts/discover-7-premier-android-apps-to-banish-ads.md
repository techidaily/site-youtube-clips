### Method 3: Can go with YouTube browser

Hey guys, there is one more trick. Whenever you want to access YouTube, instead of going through the application, try to open YouTube website either from your mobile or PC browser window. You would wonder why so and what difference it will make. The fact is that the Shorts tab has not yet been incorporated under the browser version of YouTube.

So friends, try this to avoid seeing YouTube Shorts videos either from phone or desktop. This is not only simple but also device-free. And even if you do not have a YouTube application, you can use this trick to solve your concern.

### Method 4: Factory reset

If you disagree with the shorts video and want to get off of it entirely. This trick might help you. For this, visit the YouTube app on your mobile and press on it for some time. Doing so will lead you to the info section under the settings.

When you click on the **Uninstall** option, the YouTube version will get downgraded to the factory version. This is the version that is a pre-installed version of YouTube that comes with the device.

Also, if you have not updated your YouTube app, then don’t go with that. However, you will receive notifications many times that you should update your application. Just ignore it, especially if you are not willing to add the Shorts video option on your YouTube application.

### Method 5: Link to downgrade the YouTube

Friends, for every problem, there exists some solution. And, if you are finding it difficult to factory reset the YouTube, you can download the downgraded version of YouTube. This is the version that does not contain the YouTube Shorts feature. Do like this:

1. Visit the [Link](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-14-12-56-release/youtube-14-12-56-16-android-apk-download/) and download the downgraded version.
2. Install by allowing unknown resources also.
3. Then, disable the auto-update of the YouTube option also.

**Note:** While downloading and installing this version, you need to allow installation from unknown sources.

### Method 7: Try YouTube Vanced

Wait, the list is not over yet. If none of the previous methods work, try **YouTube Vanced**, the advanced and premium version of YouTube to get rid of YouTube Shorts. Well, not only that, but YouTube Vanced also comes up with multiple services that you can enjoy along with it, such as disabling YouTube Shorts, blocking ads, stories, or any of the sponsored features.

If not sure how to go about it, then let’s have a look over the following steps that will guide you to get YouTube Vanced.

**Step 1: Download YouTube Vanced**

First, download the YouTube Vanced application from its website.

**Step 2: Install and complete the setup process**

After that, complete the installation process and follow the on-screen direction rightly to make it work effectively for you.

**Note:** If you are downloading from the website, not from the app store, then there might appear the warning. So ignore that and go with the downloading and installation process.

**Step 3: Open application and visit settings**

Once you have launched the application, under the settings, you need to go for the **Vanced settings** option> there opt for "Ad settings" > at the end of the page, switch on the **Shorts shelf**.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/disable-youtube-shorts-5.jpg)

Doing so will disable the YouTube Shorts option from the **Home** screen.

Alternatively, remove the **YouTube Shorts** button also from the screen. Under the “Vanced settings” > Visit **Layout settings** \> Switch on the **Comments location** option. That will further remove the Shorts button from the bottom end of the Home screen of the YouTube page.

Voila, now you can say that you get rid of those shorts videos by removing shorts from YouTube using YouTube Vanced option.

Thus, following the methods mentioned above gives you multiple ways to turn off shorts on YouTube. I hope that now you will be able to use YouTube without any concern or interference of YouTube Shorts videos.
