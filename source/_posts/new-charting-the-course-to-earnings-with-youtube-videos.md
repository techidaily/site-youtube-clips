* [**Part1: What is YouTube affiliate marketing**](#part1)
* [**Part2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project**](#part2)
* [**Part2: 3 Tips before you begin**](#part3)

## Part 1: What is YouTube affiliate marketing?

In YouTube affiliate marketing, videos are made to encourage customers to purchase products from third-party sites including Amazon.

When users buy products via your links, you can receive commission, which can be up to 10% depending on the category of the product and how much you are selling.

Examples of YouTube affiliate marketing videos include reviews, how-to guides, un-boxing videos and more. Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.

When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.

Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more. To make your marketing program successful, you must ensure people know about your video and encourage them to click on the links and buy the products.

Though this can seem daunting at first, the more experience you gain, the more revenue you can generate.

## Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project

### Step 1: build affiliate relationship

One of the first steps you should take when getting your project off the ground is to establish relationships with brands that you love. If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.

Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.

If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up. Chances are they will be more than happy to do so, as it could be very beneficial for them.

![affiliate relationship YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-relationship.JPG)

### Step 2: Create your product video

The next step is to actually produce your video. Viewers love honesty, so don’t be afraid to say so if there is a way you feel the product or service could be improved.

Remember to include calls to action. Un-boxing videos are very popular and show viewers everything inside a package, whilst review videos can also provide valuable insights.

Top 10 lists also generate high views. You must also remember to include a disclosure that informs viewers that you are being paid via an affiliate marketing scheme. This is a legal obligation.

![product video YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/product-video.JPG)

### Step 3: Promote your content

There are many things you can do to ensure your product is seen. Share your video on all your social media channels, respond to as many questions from viewers as possible and add links to online environments where the product is already being discussed.

Set up a channel that can be found when relevant search terms are used and make sure your titles are optimized for search too.

![promote YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote.JPG)

## Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin

### 1\. Commission Rate

All brands have different commission rates, with some offering up to 50% and others providing around 5%. Make sure you know what the rates are before you proceed and read the terms and conditions carefully. You may well wish to create a dedicated channel or channels to bring everything together. If you’re passionate about other people’s products, it makes perfect sense to get paid to talk about them.

![comission rate YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comission-rate.JPG)

### 2\. Where affiliate links appear

Affiliate links are placed below the YouTube video in the description. One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.

It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible. The more views you receive, the more favorably your content will be treated by YouTube.

![affiliate links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-links.JPG)

### 3\. Know your product well

It is really essential to know your product inside out when you are marketing it to viewers. YouTube viewers expect you to be an expert when it comes to the products you are showcasing, so take as much time as you need to gain an in-depth understanding of how it works and what its features are.

You must also be able to explain why it makes so much sense to choose the specific product or service over its competitors. Try not to be repetitive, use HD footage and a quality mic, avoid link spamming, choose the best kind of video for the product and plan out the video before you start creating it. Again, engage with your audience as much as you can.

![know product](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/know-product.JPG)

## Conclusion

There are various great reasons for getting involved in YouTube affiliate marketing. You may be amazed to see just how much cash you can generate when you follow the above steps and create inspiring videos that showcase products in the best possible light. Just remember to be honest and talk about the cons as well as the pros if they are any. Doing this will help you become a trusted, authentic YouTube affiliate marketer. Why wait any longer to get started?

 Latest survey shows that Google’s video streaming site Youtube has surpassed radio, as well as CDs to be the most popular way American adolescents listen to music.
