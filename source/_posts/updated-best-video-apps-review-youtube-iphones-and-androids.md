A YouTube channel is a great way to generate revenye. Quality content attracts a large audience, enabling a way to generate ad revenue.

Each view will generate $0.10 to $0.30 or an average of $0.018\. The YouTuber will be paid $18 on average for a video with 1,000 ad views. The amount paid depends on the CPM (Cost per Mille), which is the cost of advertising to 1,000 people. Brands will incur between $4 and $24 on YouTube to advertise on YouTube. However, the revenue generated by the Youtuber will be lower because not all the 1,000 views will be ad views.
