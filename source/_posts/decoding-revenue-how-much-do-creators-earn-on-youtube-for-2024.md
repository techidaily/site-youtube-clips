#### 1. Take full advantage of the First Line

 As the most important text in the YouTube video description, the text in the first line will appear both in the YouTube search result and the social media. It is recommended to write a short video description but for SEO purpose, keep in mind to contain the main keywords and write a clickbaity text.

 Besides the first line, Line 2 and Line 3 are also most visible in the video description. You can write a short explanation text for Line 1 or tell the audiences what to do next such as download the software or sub to your channel.

#### 2.Add helpful text to the description

 It is highly recommended to add additional relevant content to the video description to help audience to get to know you better. You can add a brief summary of the video content or the transcript of the video here. Normally, you can add anything that is worth mentioning such as the equipment or software that you are using to make the video.
