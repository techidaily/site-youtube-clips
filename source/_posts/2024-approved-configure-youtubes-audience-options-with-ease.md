## Part 1: Public VS Unlisted VS Private

 Let's figure out some terms before runing into the how-to part.

 **Public Videos**

 These are videos that everyone can view. This is the majority of YouTube videos, and just about every one you’ve ever watched will have been public. You'll want this if you want lots of people to watch your video.

 **Unlisted**

 Unlisted videos are ones that anybody can view so long as they have the link. The video won’t show up on search results or in "related" or "suggested" videos.

 This is a great setting for sharing a video amongst small groups. You might have a rough edit you want to show a few people, or you might have a show reel that you only want certain people to see.

 **Private**

 Completely private videos cannot be watched by anyone who doesn’t have permission. You grant people permission by allowing their Google accounts to access the video. Nobody else can see the video, regardless of whether they have the link.

 It won’t show up on searches, as related or suggested videos, or even when imbedded in other sites. This is the best setting for a video you need to share with only very specific people, if anyone. Below is a comparison table to know more about [privacy settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=1).

![youtube privacy setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-privacy-setting.JPG)

## Part 2: How to Change Privacy Settings

 There are two ways to change the privacy settings: firstly, when you upload the video, and secondly through Creator Studio.

**Method 1:**

 When you upload a video to YouTube you'll see on the right hand side an option that says "privacy". This is defaulted to "public", but you can use the drop-down menu on the button to change the setting. This will apply your privacy setting the second the video finishes uploading and processing.

![upload youtube video privacy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-video-privacy.jpg)

**Method 2:**

 To change the privacy setting later, go to Creator Studio, then Video Manager. On the right-hand side you’ll see one of three icons: a world, a chain, and a lock. The world means **"public"**, the chain means **"unlisted"**, and the lock is for **"private"**.

![youtube privacy settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlisted-video.JPG)

 To change the privacy, click the icon. You’ll be taken to the video's info and settings page. Down below where you see the thumbnails you'll see the selected privacy setting. Click this to open a drop down menu, and select your desired privacy level.

## Part 3: Sharing Private Videos

 If a video is set to "private', you'll have the option to share it with specific people. Below where it says "private" on the info and settings page you'll see a button labeled "share". Click this and type in the email addresses of the people you want to be able to watch the video. You’ll also have the option of notifying the people via email that you’ve shared the video with them.

![share youtube privacy video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-private-video.JPG)

## Conclusion

 And that's all there is to it! Changing the privacy setting on YouTube videos is a simple, helpful tool to allow you to control the audience of you work. Enjoy!

## Angular Adjustments on YouTube Videos - The Ultimate 2023 Guide

# How to Rotate YouTube Videos by Any Angle

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

YouTube is compatible to all devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers. However, when the screen is too small, so does the video, which makes the watching experience full of inconvenience.

Sometimes, you may need to rotate the video left/right 90 degrees or 180 degrees. To rotate the YouTube video when you watching it, you can move your devices in order for you to get the perfect angle and make your watching fun and smooth.

Yet, did you know that you could possibly rotate YouTube videos either downloaded or before uploading, to the angle you are comfortable watching? Here is how.

* [Method 1: Using YouTube Video Editor to Rotate Videos After Uploading](#part1)
* [Method 2: Rotate YouTube Videos by Advanced YouTube Video Editor Alternatives](#part2)

## Method 1: Using YouTube Video Editor to Rotate Videos \[Not available after 2017\]

**Note:** After updating in 2017 September, you cannot rotate a video on YouTube Enhancement. If you need to rotate a video, you should rotate the video before uploading it to YouTube.

YouTube has a built-in video editor where you can rotate YouTube video. Here are the ways on how you can successfully rotate a YouTube video online.

* Log in to your YouTube account.
* Click the dropdown located beside your profile's thumbnail that can be found in your dashboard.
* Once you have successfully clicked the dropdown menu, you can now search for the video that you want to rotate.
* When you have already found the video, you can now click the Edit button that can easily be found under the thumbnail of the video.
* In the Edit section, choose the Enhancements tab.
* You can find in the lower right part of the video preview the arrows for rotate right and rotate left.

![rotate youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-videos.jpg)

* **\[Not Recommended\]** There is a hacky way to show Rotate button on 2021\. Right click on the **Trim** button and click **inspect** in the pop-up menu. A **DevTools** window will open with HTML codes of the **Trim** button highlighted as you can see it in the below image. Find **enhance-rotate-buttons** on the html codes, and delete the **hiddden=”true”**, then press the **Enter** button.

* Then, after choosing, you have successfully rotated the video.

 **Cons of YouTube Video Editor**

However, using YouTube Video Editor is not the best way to rotate or flip a YouTube video.

* Obviously, one of its disadvantages is that the features are very basic. You can't use more advanced functions for better edition.
* In addition, since you are doing it online, you need to keep on refreshing the page whenever you are making some changes in your video, which eats a lot of time.
* Another disadvantage of YouTube Video Editor is that you have to get access to internet, or you can't edit the videos. But it's headache when you forget to save your work or the internet crashes.
