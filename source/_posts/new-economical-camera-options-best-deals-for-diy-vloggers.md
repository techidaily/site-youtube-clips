If you are a determined and ambitious beginner, it's a good decision to invest in advanced cameras when you have an adequate budget.

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## A Step-by-Step Guide Through YouTube's Aspect Ratio Landscapes

Yes, you are right. Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.

Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.

![youtube platform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg)

Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.

#### In this article

01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)

02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)

03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)

04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:

![youtube aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg)

**Note:** YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar's white or grey/black area along the edges.

**●** YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop/PC Version:

If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)

**●** YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:

There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.

**●** YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version

Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.

Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:

![vertical video example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg)

Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.

## Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio
