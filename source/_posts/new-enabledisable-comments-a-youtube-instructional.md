## FAQs About YouTube Comments

#### 1\. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?

There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.

#### 2\. I want people to comment on my Private video. What should I do?

At the time of this writing, YouTube doesn’t allow anyone to post a comment on any video that has been set as ‘Private’. If your video is configured that way, you must change its nature to ‘Unlisted’, and share its link to the users before they can post a comment.

#### 3\. How can I block certain words and links on the YouTube comments?

You can go to **YouTube Studio** \> **Settings** \> **Community**, and on the **Automated Filters** tab in the right window, add the words to block in the **Blocked words** field.

# How To Be A Beauty Guru on YouTube: Beauty Vlogger Set Up

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Beauty Vlogs are some of the most popular channels on YouTube. These vlogs are all about aesthetics, so it is important that the videos themselves are beautiful. When you are giving out tips on makeup or hair you want to use a setup that will make your results look their very best.

## YouTube Beauty Vlogger Set Up

It’s easy to put together your own Beauty Vlog setup. There are four main elements; lighting, beauty supplies, backgrounds, and audio. Here are some tips on building your beauty guru set:

#### 1\. Light It Up

![beauty vlog01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beauty-vlog01.JPG)

Beauty Vlogs need to have great lighting so that everyone can clearly see what you are doing and how amazing it looks. Make sure you have even light over your whole face by ‘front lighting’ your vlog. Front lighting means having a light source right in front of you.

Depending on your budget, you can either use a window as a front light or buy a diva ring light.

**Using a Window:**  Face the window while you vlog and be careful that the camera’s shadow is not visible in your shot. Avoid using a window the sun is shining directly into. You want softer, more diffused, light for a beauty vlog.

**Using a Ring Light:**  Mount your camera either inside the ring or right behind it on a tripod. Ring lights are powerful options for illuminating your entire face, and they are very popular with makeup vloggers.

Front lighting can make you appear flat against your background, so it is also a good idea to set up a backlight behind you to make you pop out. Setting up lights on either side of you can also help add dimension to your shot.

Check this tutorial to know more details:

#### 2\. Organize Your Makeup

Having to search for makeup or reach across to where you are storing your curling iron will kill your vlogging momentum. Creating a great look is the fun part of beauty vlogging, and probably the part you want to focus on. Not looking for your missing brush. The best way to set yourself up for a beauty vlog is at a desk or table where you can lay everything out neatly right in front of you.

#### 3\. Alter Your Background

Making your vlog look more professional can be as easy as dressing up your background. You do not want there to be a lot of clutter behind you, but you don’t want to shoot with your back to a plain beige wall either. One simple way to keep your background beautiful, but not distracting, is to use a backdrop. Just hang a sheet or other piece of fabric behind you. You can even use patterns and change your backdrop to match your makeup in different videos.

Another great way to disguise the room you are vlogging in, and make sure nothing behind you distracts your viewers, is to blur your background. You really stand out when your background is blurry and you are in perfect focus.

#### 4\. Be Audible

You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you. Most cameras do not have great microphones, so you will need to use an external mic. To see what kinds of options you have make sure to read and watch “[Best Microphone for YouTube - Top 5 Mics for YouTube Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)”.

If you do not have access to an external mic then you may be able to get by without one for a while using software. Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.

Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.

Beauty Vlogs are some of the most popular channels on YouTube. These vlogs are all about aesthetics, so it is important that the videos themselves are beautiful. When you are giving out tips on makeup or hair you want to use a setup that will make your results look their very best.

## YouTube Beauty Vlogger Set Up

It’s easy to put together your own Beauty Vlog setup. There are four main elements; lighting, beauty supplies, backgrounds, and audio. Here are some tips on building your beauty guru set:

#### 1\. Light It Up

Beauty Vlogs need to have great lighting so that everyone can clearly see what you are doing and how amazing it looks. Make sure you have even light over your whole face by ‘front lighting’ your vlog. Front lighting means having a light source right in front of you.

Depending on your budget, you can either use a window as a front light or buy a diva ring light.

**Using a Window:**  Face the window while you vlog and be careful that the camera’s shadow is not visible in your shot. Avoid using a window the sun is shining directly into. You want softer, more diffused, light for a beauty vlog.

**Using a Ring Light:**  Mount your camera either inside the ring or right behind it on a tripod. Ring lights are powerful options for illuminating your entire face, and they are very popular with makeup vloggers.

Front lighting can make you appear flat against your background, so it is also a good idea to set up a backlight behind you to make you pop out. Setting up lights on either side of you can also help add dimension to your shot.

#### 2\. Organize Your Makeup

Having to search for makeup or reach across to where you are storing your curling iron will kill your vlogging momentum. Creating a great look is the fun part of beauty vlogging, and probably the part you want to focus on. Not looking for your missing brush. The best way to set yourself up for a beauty vlog is at a desk or table where you can lay everything out neatly right in front of you.

#### 3\. Alter Your Background

Making your vlog look more professional can be as easy as dressing up your background. You do not want there to be a lot of clutter behind you, but you don’t want to shoot with your back to a plain beige wall either. One simple way to keep your background beautiful, but not distracting, is to use a backdrop. Just hang a sheet or other piece of fabric behind you. You can even use patterns and change your backdrop to match your makeup in different videos.

Another great way to disguise the room you are vlogging in, and make sure nothing behind you distracts your viewers, is to blur your background. You really stand out when your background is blurry and you are in perfect focus.

#### 4\. Be Audible

You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you. Most cameras do not have great microphones, so you will need to use an external mic. To see what kinds of options you have make sure to read and watch “[Best Microphone for YouTube - Top 5 Mics for YouTube Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)”.

If you do not have access to an external mic then you may be able to get by without one for a while using software. Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.
