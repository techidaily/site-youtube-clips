Suggested Videos/Playlists: A link to recommended videos or playlists.

* [**Part 2: How to Create Outstanding YouTube Outro?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: 5 Video Effects to Help You Create a Stunning YouTube Outro**](#part3)

## Part 1: What is an Outro?

Still, wondering what is the outro meaning? Simply put, an outro is the closing part of your video content. YouTube outros appear at the end of your video and act as a wrap-up for your content. Without a suitable outro, videos are likely to appear abrupt and rushed. Creating a proper outro helps create a clean and appropriate finishing and also helps to increase engagement with the audience.

![example of youtube outro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-outstanding-youtube-outro-1.jpg)

A YouTube outro can serve other functions as well, such as prompting the viewers for certain actions. You can add a call-to-action button, links to websites, or other suggested content at the end screen of your video. Other content that can be included in a YouTube outro can be:

Suggested Videos/Playlists: A link to recommended videos or playlists.

Website Links: Links to an external website.

Subscribe Prompt: Ask the viewer to subscribe to your YouTube channel.

Channel Links: Attached link to a different channel on YouTube.

## Part 2: How to Create Outstanding YouTube Outro?

Want to know how to make an outro for your YouTube video? YouTube outros can serve numerous purposes to the user when done right. Let's look at the important elements of a perfectly comprised YouTube outro and how you can create one from scratch.

### Things to Consider

Following are some important things that you might need to consider while making an outro for YouTube:

* **Technical Specifications**

Ideally, a YouTube outro should be in the aspect ratio of 16:9\. Keep the resolution of your outro maintained at 1920x1080 pixels. Also, ensure that the outro appears on the screen for up to eight seconds or longer, depending upon the length of your video.

* **Simplicity**

Your YouTube outros do not need to be over the top and flowing with creative elements. Choose a simple and elegant design that does not clutter the screen.

* **Empty Spaces**

Like all other digital designs, make sure that your YouTube outro has plenty of white spaces so elements do not appear crowded and distracting.

* **Appropriate CTAs**

If you are using CTAs in your outro, remember to add links and elements that are relevant. Your call-to-action buttons should be related to the video and should make sense to the viewer.

* **Consistency**

Being consistent in your designs is a key ingredient to improving your brand recognition. Stick to a specific color palette or themes, so the audience can easily identify your channel.

### How to Make an Outstanding YouTube Video Outro

Now it is time to learn how to make an outro for YouTube. You can create the perfect outro for YouTube using the tools from Adobe After Effects. The following steps indicate how to make an outro using After Effects:

Step 1: Pre-Process Preparation

Launch After Effects and import the files you want in your end screen, such as logos of social media platforms.
