_Navin explains this issue really clearly._

YouTube announced changes to its Partnership Program for some time. For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.

My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.

![ Become YouTube Partner should be easier](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hard-to-become-youtube-partner.jpg)

_I was prepared to go to war over this. Or do an angry blog post. One of those._

However, when you consider YouTube’s reasons for imposing this milestone, it actually starts to make a lot of sense. Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.

#### 1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number

This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.

Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).

If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.

#### 2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money

![ the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg)

_Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough. This is just a little extra weight._

How much money could you earn off of 10,000 views, anyways? Not much.

You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.

It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.

#### 3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized

YouTube has been having issues with advertisers lately. A lot of brands have been justifiably miffed that their products are appearing next to some violent, threatening, objectively offensive content. Anyone could monetize, and some pretty bad eggs took advantage of that.

Now that channels will be applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program instead of simply activating the feature, there can be a real screening process. Channels with content that violates YouTube’s Community Guidelines can be barred from monetization.

#### 4. Thieves won’t profit

There are people out there who want views, subscribers, and nice comments but who do not want to put any real work into getting them. It isn’t uncommon for someone like this to download a video they like and post it to their own channel.

This reposted video will steal views and ad revenue away from the real post on the creator’s channel.

Having a review process for the Partnership Program will help ensure that these content thieves are caught before they can make any money.

YouTube also recently made it easier to report users for impersonation, regardless of how many views they have.

_TheGamingGuy looked into people who had stolen his logo and found out they had also stolen whole videos from other YouTubers._

There are clear benefits to this new milestone, but there are also some questions remaining.

## How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?

It will help stop them from making money themselves, but not from siphoning away views from other channels. The impersonation rules only apply if somebody is pretending to be another creator. You can steal and repost someone’s content without pretending to be them.

This new rule does take away money as an incentive for stealing content, but a lot of people doing this probably aren’t in it for the money. They might just be misguided fans who want to repost videos they enjoy.

## Could this affect your CPM?

Competition plays a huge role in how much YouTubers earn from ad revenue. Some genres are bigger on YouTube than others and, the more popular your genre is, the more options advertisers have. The more competition there is for higher-paying ads, the larger your channel has to be to get them.

Could this new milestone decrease competition in some genres?

Initially, iOS users had the option to load videos directly to YouTube via the tap-to-upload feature. However, this option is missing in the recent iOS devices versions. Therefore, many users search for possible ways to post a video on YouTube from iPhone. For this, you have to put some considerations into place before moving on. The video title length should not exceed 100 characters, while the description is maintained at 5,000 characters. Also, ensure the video length doesn't exceed 15 minutes. Let's roll out the best ways to upload your videos and make that big catch on subscribers.

**Step 2.** Click on the "+" icon found at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3.** Then choose the "Upload a video" option from the populated list of options.

**Step 4.** Check out the pop-up that appears and "Allow access" to it.

**Step 5.** Edit your video to your preference by trimming or cropping as you desire. Then click on the "Next" option.

![upload youtube video from iphone using ios app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-youtube-video-from-iphone-2.png)

**Step 6.** Add "title and description" to your video. Remember, the title should contain less than 100 characters and the description no more than 500 characters.

**Step 7.** Then set the visibility mode as "Public" to enable you to share your video over the internet.

**Step 8.** Click on the "Upload" button to finally upload your video to YouTube.

**Step 1.** Go to your iOS device and tap on the "Photos" app.

**Step 2.** Then tap on the "Videos Folder" to locate the video you wish to upload to YouTube.

**Step 4.** Then tap on the "Share" icon located at the bottom left of your iOS device screen.

**Step 5.** You'll then access a "Share" menu from where you have various share options for your video.

**Step 6.** Choose the "YouTube" option to continue to share your video there. At this juncture, ensure you have logged in to your Google Account.

![upload youtube video from iphone using Photo app - export using YouTube app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-youtube-video-from-iphone-5.png)

**Step 7.** You need to provide a "Title" and "Description" of your video. Then go to the "Privacy" Options and make your video "Public."

**Step 8.** Finally, tap on the "Publish" tab found at the top-right corner of your screen to make your video viewable by the public.

![upload youtube video from iphone using safari](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-youtube-vidoe-from-iphone-8.png)

**Step 6.** Add your video's "title and description" and hit the "Next" button.

**Step 7.** Tap on the "Next" button once more to go to the "Visibility" page.

**Step 8.** Select the "Public" option to upload your video to the public.

## Why your phone doesn't post videos to YouTube

Despite learning how to upload to YouTube from iPhone, you may be perplexed to realize that your phone refuses to post videos to YouTube. What could be the reason?

#### 1) YouTube issues

In most cases, the problem doesn't arise from your phone but from YouTube. This streaming app may also experience some hitches along the way. Remember that even if your phone sync with your YouTube account to upload videos from the "Camera Roll," YouTube isn't managed from the Camera Roll but the YouTube app directly. You can solve the issue by signing out of your YouTube account and signing back in.

#### 2) Connection Strength

It is important to add a title and description to your video. Just use the "Titles" button to add the title. Other precepts that you can add include transitions, sound like voice-over,

**Step 4.** Export and share
You've just finished creating and editing your video. Click on the "Save" tab and let the application export your video. Then select the "Save to Camera Roll" option to save the video to your iPhone. Finally, you can upload and share the video directly to your YouTube account.

## Conclusion
