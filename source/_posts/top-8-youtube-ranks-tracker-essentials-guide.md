![add subscribe watermark filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-10.jpg)

Step5 Change the position where the Subscribe watermark should appear in your video. Then, play the video to preview it.

Step6 After you’re done with the editing, click the Export button from the top bar and choose Burn DVD from the drop-down list that shows up.
