There are a lot of ways you can make money by posting makeup, beauty, or fashion videos on YouTube. These are all industries that understand the value of quality social media content.

 In the video above, [beauty YouTuber](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Gena M explains all the ways there are to make money posting makeup and fashion videos on YouTube. Gena’s most important piece of advice for other beauty vloggers is, to be honest. There is nothing wrong with making money from affiliates or sponsors, so long as you only associate with and recommend products you would actually buy.

Here’s more advice on how you can make money from your makeup videos:

## Sponsorships

If you are truly passionate about makeup or fashion then you probably have a few favorite brands. Even if you have never really thought about a brand as your favorite, chances are you purchase one or two types of lip gloss – or any other product – over others on a regular basis.

Wouldn’t it be nice if a company whose product you already love and use in your videos would start paying you just to mention them?

There are sites called influencer marketing platforms – the most popular one is FameBit – where you can find brands that are looking for creators just like you to work with them on marketing campaigns. Brands post what they are looking for, and you send them proposals for what kinds of videos you want to make for them.

Sometimes, creating branded content can be as easy as drawing attention to the brand of the eyeliner you use in a few of your tutorials.

Other times, brands may want you to say specific things or include logos in your videos.

Make sure to incorporate any brand messages or product placement you agree to do in ways that will feel natural to your viewers. You should let them know that you have a sponsor, and then incorporate the branded content in ways that do not take away from their enjoyment of your videos.

## Ad Revenue

Monetizing your videos and earning ad revenue is one of the primary ways beauty vloggers, and all other YouTubers, make money. It takes a long time to earn more than the pocket change from ads, but so long as you keep growing your audience your revenue will keep going up.

Pay attention to the estimated revenue reports to see which of your videos are earning the most money from ads (they won’t always be your most popular videos). By making more videos on similar topics you will be able to make more money.

## Affiliate Links

By becoming an Amazon affiliate, or joining the affiliate program of another online store, you can make money by including links to products in the descriptions of your video or in your related blog posts.

For example, if you talk about your new curling iron in a hair tutorial then you can include a special link to it on Amazon. If any of your viewers follow that link and buy it, you earn a percentage of the purchase.

Even better – if that person keeps shopping, or even skips the curling iron and buys something else, you earn a percentage of any purchase they make on Amazon for a certain period of time.

Affiliate links are mostly used by bloggers, not YouTubers, but you can still include them in the descriptions of your videos (not YouTube Cards or annotations though). It is not a bad idea for you to create blog posts to accompany your videos and post your affiliate links. Blogs are a great way to generate traffic to your videos.

Together with its sister product Screensaver Factory, Screensaver Wonder is one of the most popular screensaver software products in the world, helping thousands of users decorate their computer screens quickly and easily.</a>

## Gifts

Sometimes companies might just give you stuff.

As your following gets bigger, brands might start sending you samples of their products in the hopes that you will fall in love with them and mention, review, or use them in your videos. This is not the same as a sponsorship because the brand is not paying you for a specific kind of message.

Receiving these kinds of gifts is not the same as getting paid, but it can certainly save you money on makeup.

## Why Do We Need to Check YouTube Ranking?

#### Allows You to Know if Your Videos Are Performing Well

The main goal of most users is to rank number one on search results. So checking your rank position will help you know if your videos appear on YouTube and Google's top results. Most users watch videos on the top of search results. For this reason, if you are not ranking at the top of search results, you will miss out on traffic.

Knowing where you rank on search results will allow you to develop an effective strategy that will help you increase your views and grow your following.

#### Allows You to Change Your Low Ranking State

Question: What will affect the ranking of your YouTube video?
