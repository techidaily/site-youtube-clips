People put loads of effort and money into making the kind of videos that would gain popularity and, in turn, provide them with an excellent earning opportunity.

**Understand the Audience**

Knowing what the audience demands and how your content can be more engaging are a key to becoming popular.

**Hire an expert team**

Along with the research, your online presence and how you present yourself are essential. Even though you may lay the foundations of a channel, the team helps you, with their expertise, in making successful content to upload. This would increase the chance of videos becoming popular.

**Produce Quality Content**

Lastly, creating quality content is essential for a successful YouTuber. Making and editing videos is a straightforward process that can be carried out using various softwares.

Once you deliver your all, patience is all you need since no YouTuber has become trending in a day!

##### Step6 Add effects, stock video, elements, and transitions from Filmora's vast library

Filmora has additional features like stock photos and video footage that can be added to enhance the beauty of the video content.

**Effects:**

Go to the top menu and click on effects; you can find many of them; they are categorized in the left vertical menu.

![filmora effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-14.jpg)

**Stock Videos:**

Go to the official site of [Filmora video stocks](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/). There are a large number of video templates, stock videos, images, and audio files.

You can also access the stock videos from Pixels, Giphy, Pixabay, and Unsplash without leaving the Filmora Software. Go to the Stock Media section in the top menu to access these.

Now you can easily find content to make your videos attractive.

![filmora stock media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-15.jpg)

**Elements:**

Filmora has an extensive stock of Elements; with the proper use of Elements in YouTube videos, you can make them engaging and interactive. You already know the importance of interactive videos.

Find multiple elements from the Element section beside the effects and transition section in Filmora.

![filmora elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-16.jpg)

**Transition:**

Transition smoothens the video, especially when various clips are combined. Use transitions from the Filmora Transition section and set the stage for the next scene, convey the mood and smoothen your YouTube video.

![filmora transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-17.jpg)

The presence of this library reduces the labor of finding images on the internet, makes them accessible to the user, and makes the video interesting.

##### Step7 Export and save the video

The video is saved by simply clicking ‘ Export.’ You can always share the video online or offline, either publish directly on social media or save it on your computer for later upload.

![export video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-18.jpg)

The quality content that you obtain from Filmora can now be used to inspire millions of viewers out there. You are just an upload away!
