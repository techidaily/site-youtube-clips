## Part 2: How to make and apply a green screen background

In our last article, we have shared with you [how to make and use green screen footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

While, in this article, we won't repeat it but just share with you some tips for making and applying green screen footage in video editings.

The core objective is to have a smooth one colored background which is easy to replace in post-production. Since the green screen is employed in the film industry on a mega scale, professional green screen kits are quite expensive. Hence it is much more feasible that a DIY solution is employed for the required results.

For a good quality result from a DIY green screen, you need to take care of the following items:

### 1\. Screen Quality

Green screens can be wall painted with a chroma key, a large sheet of cloth hung without any creases, or a portable setup canvas that can cover the given area.

### 2\. Lightning

The most important thing to be kept in mind is that your background should be lit evenly. Any shadows on the background should be avoided. The distance of the subject should be at least ten feet from the background, to minimize any kind of shadow.
