# 17 Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Videos

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Great lighting is important if you want people to watch your YouTube videos from start to finish. Viewers want to be able to see you clearly and will click away if they cannot. Natural light works great, and it's cheap, so if it is possible you might want to consider vlogging outside. Of course, not every type of vlog is suited to the outdoors.

Unfortunately, it is unlikely you will be able to get good quality light from the lamps and ceiling lights in your home. Floor lamps can be useful for filling shadows or backlighting but are not usually powerful enough to use as your main light. Natural light is, so one way you can get around needing a lot of lighting equipment is to use a window as your main light. This is not always possible, though. If you are going to vlog from inside your house then there is a good chance you will need to invest in some lighting equipment.

* [Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Video Shooting](#part3)

## Part 1: Best Types of Lightning Equipment for YouTube Videos

Every video no matter how long or short depends on light, more than anything else. The natural light sources are often not powerful enough to light a scene you're trying to capture, so to avoid having to deal with underexposed footage, the best solution is to use artificial lighting. Even if you want the light in your video to be completely natural, you still have to figure out a way to get rid of shadows, which brings us back to different types of lighting equipment that can be used to increase the quality of the footage you're producing.

#### 1\.  Softbox Lights

Shooting videos with only natural light will put a lot of challenges in front of you, and the best way to overcome them is to use softbox lights. These natural light emulators mimic the natural light by using diffusion panels to make the light look softer and less artificial.

Softbox lights enable you to direct light to the exact spot in the shot, and they make lighting subjects and particular parts of a scene much easier. Softboxes are available in all shapes and sizes at very reasonable prices, and they are a standard part of the equipment used for the production of YouTube videos.

#### 2\.  Umbrella Lights

The newcomers to the world of YouTube video production are going to love using these lights. The umbrella lights provide a much broader source of light than the softbox lights and they are frequently used to light the entire scene. You can also add extra light on the video's subject if you're looking to get a more balanced shot.

They are portable and quite handy if you often shoot in different locations since you can easily pack and carry them to wherever you plan on shooting your next YouTube video.

#### 3\.  Ring Lights

Although they are most frequently used for fashion and beauty videos, ring lights are a great option whenever you need to make sure that the subjects of the video are perfectly lit. These circular lights have an amount in the center, so the camera's point of view is identical to the direction from which the light is coming.

Ring lights are powerful enough to provide light for an entire scene, and they also work nicely as a catch or fill light. Some of the most popular YouTubers like Casy Neistat or PewDiePie use ring lights in their videos.

## Part 2: What Should Good Lighting Equipment Feature?

Now that you know which types of lights are commonly used on YouTube video sets, you can start looking at models that best fit your demands. There are thousands of different studio lights on the market, but only the best offer features that make the light setup process easier and faster. So before buying your lighting equipment, you should make sure that it has the following features.

#### 1\.  Adjustable Beam Spread

The equipment you use should allow you to control how wide the light is spreading. This is particularly useful when you want to light just one subject in the shot while keeping the rest in the dark. Lights with an adjustable beam spread to give you versatility and enable you to adapt to a wider range of scenes.

#### 2\.  The Height of the Light Stand

Most lighting kits include stands, but not all stands allow you to change the height at which the light is positioned. This can largely limit your options on the set, which is why you need to check if the stand is adjustable. You'll also want to do a background check on the stand's durability, because low-quality stands may cause damage to the lights and other equipment.

#### 3\.  Portability

How portable your lighting equipment should be is directly related to the genre of YouTube videos you want to produce. If you are planning on shooting in studio conditions, then portability is not such an important factor, but if you want to shoot at a different location every day then portability becomes something you simply must consider.

#### 4\.  Accessories

Most lightning kits include a number of handy accessories that help you achieve better results. Reflectors, barn doors, diffusers, scrims, and mounting accessories are all commonly featured in high-quality lighting kits, and you shouldn't buy a kit that doesn't offer at least some of the accessories we mentioned here.

#### 5\. All About Reflectors/Diffusers

White reflectors are used to simply bounce light. Silver reflectors make light a bit colder-looking, and gold reflectors give things a slightly warmer, more glamourous, look. Black and translucent 'reflectors' are not really for bouncing light. The black reflector blocks light, which is useful if you are trying to focus your main light so it is only lighting you and not everything behind you. The translucent reflector is actually a diffuser. Diffusers are usually set up between you and your main light to soften it and make it easier on your eyes.

Reflectors are used to bounce light towards your subject. They are great for filling shadows created by your main light. This reflector is five reflectors in one: silver, gold, black, white, and translucent.

## Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Videos

Consumer-level camera sensors are nowhere close to being as sensitive to light as our eyes. So a scene that may look sufficiently lit to our eyes may be too dark for the camera. When you're shooting video indoors, you'll need additional lighting equipment. Here are some of the top seventeen best lighting equipment for YouTubers.

### List of the Top 5 Best On-Camera LED Lights

**What is an On-Camera LED Light?**

On-Camera LED lights are LED lights that can be mounted directly onto your camera's hot/cold shoe (the little bracket on the top of a lot of DSLR cameras). On-camera LED lights are great for on-the-go YouTubers and YouTubers short on recording space because these lights are small and portable.

#### 1\. [Julius Studio 160 LED Light with 4 Color Filters](https://www.amazon.com/Julius-Studio-Dimmable-Panasonic-JGG2161/dp/B00QJDZ20U/)

![Julius Studio Lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-equipment-julius-studio.jpg)

The Julius Studio 160 LED light not only can be mounted on any digital camera that has a hot/cold shoe but it can also be mounted on light stands so you can keep the same light setting even if you are moving the camera around. This lighting equipment also comes with four color filters so that you can control the color temperature of your light.

#### 2\. Viltrox L116B highest RA CRI95 LED Light Panel

![Viltrox lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lighting-equipment-viltrox.jpg)

The VILTROX L116B LED light panel is a powerful piece of on-camera lighting equipment.

#### 4\. Neewer CN-216 216PCS LED Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel

#### 5\. [Neewer 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel](https://www.amazon.com/Dimmable-Digital-Camcorder-Panasonic-Samsung/dp/B004TJ6JH6/)

This light is Neewer's cheaper version of the CN-216\. Instead of having 216 LED light bulbs, this light has 160 LED light bulbs. Other than the number of light bulbs, the two light panels are pretty much the same.

### List of the Top 5 Best LED Ring Lights

LED ring lights are called ring lights because of their ring-like shape. The opening in the ring allows you to position your camera right in the center of this lighting equipment. These lights are great if you don't have a lot of space.

#### 1\. [Diva Ring Light Super Nova](https://www.amazon.com/Diva-Ring-Light-Dimmable-Stand/dp/B0149N4PD6/)

![Diva Ring Light Super Nova ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/led-ring-lighting-equipment-diva.jpg)

The Diva ring light is a great ring light for divas, make-up artists, and anyone else wanting to look good right in front of the camera! This LED ring light has a dimming knob so that you can adjust the brightness of your light. It also comes with a cloth for you to diffuse your light (so that your light will be softer) and a gooseneck and z-bracket attachment if you want to use your camera and ring light with just one tripod.

#### 2\. [Prismatic Halo Ring Light](https://www.amazon.com/Prismatic-18-Halo-Ring-Light/dp/B011CO4HPG/)

![Prismatic Halo Ring Light ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/led-ring-lighting-equipment-prismatic.jpg)

#### 3\. [Neewer Dimmable 18" Ring Light](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-10086031-Dimmable-Diameter-Fluorescent/dp/B018G039IU/)

![Neewer Dimmable  Ring Light ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/led-ring-lighting-equipment-neewer-dimmable.jpg)

The 18-inch light ring uses fluorescent light. In addition, this kit includes a 59-inch light stand as well as white and orange filters and a hot shoe adapter that extends the capabilities of this affordable LED ring light kit.

#### 4\. [FalconEyes DVR-300](https://www.amazon.com/FalconEyes%C2%AE-DVR-300-3000K-7000K-Adjustable-Photography/dp/B00XBQNN8G/)

#### 5\. [Neewer 14â€³ Ring Light](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-centimeters-Fluorescent-Photography-Equivalent/dp/B00V33KSCI/)

![Neewer 14  Ring Light ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/led-ring-lighting-equipment-neewer-ring-light.jpg)

The 10-inch inner rim diameter may seem small when compared with larger ring lights that offer more room to operate. The Neewer Camera Ring Light is undimmable and has 50W power. The ring light uses an AC adapter, which makes it difficult to use when filming outside of a studio.

### List of the Top 2 Best Softbox Video Lights

A softbox is commonly used by photographers and videographers to simulate natural light. This effect is achieved with the aid of a diffusion panel that is placed around the light source that produces continuous light. Softboxes are often less expensive than other professional lighting equipment which makes them a great option if you are working on a budget.

#### 1\. [StudioFX 2400 Watt Softbox](https://www.amazon.com/StudioFX-H9004SB2-Photography-Continuous-Hairlight/dp/B00MBVOIJU/)

Each lighthead can hold four 5500K fluorescent or daylight bulbs that are perfectly suited for work in studio conditions.

### List of the Top 5 Best Umbrella Video Lights

Unlike ring lights or softboxes that provide directional light, the umbrella video lights basically bounce the light off a reflecting surface onto a subject and enable you to get a more balanced light in your videos. They are often combined with other lighting equipment to create natural scenes without hard shadows.

#### 1\. [LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Light Lighting Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FHZ2SI/)

![LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Light ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/umbrella-lighting-equipment-limostudio.jpg)

In addition to three lamps (two white umbrellas with 86-inch light stands and one 28-inch light stand), this kit also comes with three 45W CFL bulbs. The lamps can be tilted upward or downward, so you can find the best light position for your shot. The 9-foot cords can be used with standard 110/120V USA sockets.

#### 2\. [Neewer 8.5ft x 10ft Background With 600W Umbrella Kit](https://www.newegg.com/p/0TX-00DH-001M9)

#### 3\. [Emart 600W Studio Photography Photo/Video Portrait Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018KE5XUO/)

![ Emart 600W Studio Photography Photo/Video Portrait Kit ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/umbrella-lighting-equipment-emart.jpg)

#### 4\. [LINCO 600W Photography/Video Continuous Lighting Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018KE5XUO/)

![LINCO 600W Photography/Video Continuous Lighting Kit ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/umbrella-lighting-equipment-linco.jpg)

The Linco 600W continuous lighting kit contains two white translucent umbrellas that generate soft light, which is quite useful if you want to get even skin tones in your videos. The kit has three lamps that use 5500K 40W bulbs and light stands you can easily carry to any filming location.

#### 5\. [Emart 1575W Umbrella Lighting Kit With Translucent White & Black/Silver & Black/Gold](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018KE5XUO/)

![Emart 1575W  Umbrella  Lighting Kit With Translucent  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/umbrella-lighting-equipment-emart-with-translucent.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Great lighting is important if you want people to watch your YouTube videos from start to finish. Viewers want to be able to see you clearly and will click away if they cannot. Natural light works great, and it's cheap, so if it is possible you might want to consider vlogging outside. Of course, not every type of vlog is suited to the outdoors.

Unfortunately, it is unlikely you will be able to get good quality light from the lamps and ceiling lights in your home. Floor lamps can be useful for filling shadows or backlighting but are not usually powerful enough to use as your main light. Natural light is, so one way you can get around needing a lot of lighting equipment is to use a window as your main light. This is not always possible, though. If you are going to vlog from inside your house then there is a good chance you will need to invest in some lighting equipment.

* [Part 1: Best Types of Lightning Equipment for YouTube Videos](#part1)
* [Part 2: What Should Good Lighting Equipment Feature?](#part2)
* [Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Video Shooting](#part3)

## Part 1: Best Types of Lightning Equipment for YouTube Videos

Every video no matter how long or short depends on light, more than anything else. The natural light sources are often not powerful enough to light a scene you're trying to capture, so to avoid having to deal with underexposed footage, the best solution is to use artificial lighting. Even if you want the light in your video to be completely natural, you still have to figure out a way to get rid of shadows, which brings us back to different types of lighting equipment that can be used to increase the quality of the footage you're producing.

#### 1\.  Softbox Lights

Shooting videos with only natural light will put a lot of challenges in front of you, and the best way to overcome them is to use softbox lights. These natural light emulators mimic the natural light by using diffusion panels to make the light look softer and less artificial.

Softbox lights enable you to direct light to the exact spot in the shot, and they make lighting subjects and particular parts of a scene much easier. Softboxes are available in all shapes and sizes at very reasonable prices, and they are a standard part of the equipment used for the production of YouTube videos.

#### 2\.  Umbrella Lights

The newcomers to the world of YouTube video production are going to love using these lights. The umbrella lights provide a much broader source of light than the softbox lights and they are frequently used to light the entire scene. You can also add extra light on the video's subject if you're looking to get a more balanced shot.

They are portable and quite handy if you often shoot in different locations since you can easily pack and carry them to wherever you plan on shooting your next YouTube video.

#### 3\.  Ring Lights

Although they are most frequently used for fashion and beauty videos, ring lights are a great option whenever you need to make sure that the subjects of the video are perfectly lit. These circular lights have an amount in the center, so the camera's point of view is identical to the direction from which the light is coming.

Ring lights are powerful enough to provide light for an entire scene, and they also work nicely as a catch or fill light. Some of the most popular YouTubers like Casy Neistat or PewDiePie use ring lights in their videos.

## Part 2: What Should Good Lighting Equipment Feature?

Now that you know which types of lights are commonly used on YouTube video sets, you can start looking at models that best fit your demands. There are thousands of different studio lights on the market, but only the best offer features that make the light setup process easier and faster. So before buying your lighting equipment, you should make sure that it has the following features.

#### 1\.  Adjustable Beam Spread

The equipment you use should allow you to control how wide the light is spreading. This is particularly useful when you want to light just one subject in the shot while keeping the rest in the dark. Lights with an adjustable beam spread to give you versatility and enable you to adapt to a wider range of scenes.

#### 2\.  The Height of the Light Stand

Most lighting kits include stands, but not all stands allow you to change the height at which the light is positioned. This can largely limit your options on the set, which is why you need to check if the stand is adjustable. You'll also want to do a background check on the stand's durability, because low-quality stands may cause damage to the lights and other equipment.

#### 3\.  Portability

How portable your lighting equipment should be is directly related to the genre of YouTube videos you want to produce. If you are planning on shooting in studio conditions, then portability is not such an important factor, but if you want to shoot at a different location every day then portability becomes something you simply must consider.

#### 4\.  Accessories

Most lightning kits include a number of handy accessories that help you achieve better results. Reflectors, barn doors, diffusers, scrims, and mounting accessories are all commonly featured in high-quality lighting kits, and you shouldn't buy a kit that doesn't offer at least some of the accessories we mentioned here.

#### 5\. All About Reflectors/Diffusers

White reflectors are used to simply bounce light. Silver reflectors make light a bit colder-looking, and gold reflectors give things a slightly warmer, more glamourous, look. Black and translucent 'reflectors' are not really for bouncing light. The black reflector blocks light, which is useful if you are trying to focus your main light so it is only lighting you and not everything behind you. The translucent reflector is actually a diffuser. Diffusers are usually set up between you and your main light to soften it and make it easier on your eyes.

Reflectors are used to bounce light towards your subject. They are great for filling shadows created by your main light. This reflector is five reflectors in one: silver, gold, black, white, and translucent.

## Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Videos

Consumer-level camera sensors are nowhere close to being as sensitive to light as our eyes. So a scene that may look sufficiently lit to our eyes may be too dark for the camera. When you're shooting video indoors, you'll need additional lighting equipment. Here are some of the top seventeen best lighting equipment for YouTubers.

### List of the Top 5 Best On-Camera LED Lights

Black and translucent 'reflectors' are not really for bouncing light. The black reflector blocks light, which is useful if you are trying to focus your main light so it is only lighting you and not everything behind you. The translucent reflector is actually a diffuser. Diffusers are usually set up between you and your main light to soften it and make it easier on your eyes.

Reflectors are used to bounce light towards your subject. They are great for filling shadows created by your main light. This reflector is five reflectors in one: silver, gold, black, white, and translucent.

## Part 3: Best Lights and Lighting Equipment for YouTube Videos

Consumer-level camera sensors are nowhere close to being as sensitive to light as our eyes. So a scene that may look sufficiently lit to our eyes may be too dark for the camera. When you're shooting video indoors, you'll need additional lighting equipment. Here are some of the top seventeen best lighting equipment for YouTubers.

### List of the Top 5 Best On-Camera LED Lights

**What is an On-Camera LED Light?**

On-Camera LED lights are LED lights that can be mounted directly onto your camera's hot/cold shoe (the little bracket on the top of a lot of DSLR cameras). On-camera LED lights are great for on-the-go YouTubers and YouTubers short on recording space because these lights are small and portable.

#### 1\. [Julius Studio 160 LED Light with 4 Color Filters](https://www.amazon.com/Julius-Studio-Dimmable-Panasonic-JGG2161/dp/B00QJDZ20U/)

### List of the Top 5 Best LED Ring Lights

LED ring lights are called ring lights because of their ring-like shape. The opening in the ring allows you to position your camera right in the center of this lighting equipment. These lights are great if you don't have a lot of space.

#### 1\. [Diva Ring Light Super Nova](https://www.amazon.com/Diva-Ring-Light-Dimmable-Stand/dp/B0149N4PD6/)

![Diva Ring Light Super Nova ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/led-ring-lighting-equipment-diva.jpg)

This LED ring light has a dimming knob so that you can adjust the brightness of your light.

#### 3\. [Neewer Dimmable 18" Ring Light](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-10086031-Dimmable-Diameter-Fluorescent/dp/B018G039IU/)

The 10-inch inner rim diameter may seem small when compared with larger ring lights that offer more room to operate. The Neewer Camera Ring Light is undimmable and has 50W power. The ring light uses an AC adapter, which makes it difficult to use when filming outside of a studio.

### List of the Top 2 Best Softbox Video Lights

A softbox is commonly used by photographers and videographers to simulate natural light. This effect is achieved with the aid of a diffusion panel that is placed around the light source that produces continuous light. Softboxes are often less expensive than other professional lighting equipment which makes them a great option if you are working on a budget.

#### 1\. [StudioFX 2400 Watt Softbox](https://www.amazon.com/StudioFX-H9004SB2-Photography-Continuous-Hairlight/dp/B00MBVOIJU/)

They are often combined with other lighting equipment to create natural scenes without hard shadows.

#### 1\. [LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Light Lighting Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FHZ2SI/)

![LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Light ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/umbrella-lighting-equipment-limostudio.jpg)

## Part 1: Get More Views by Adding Shorts Video to the â€˜Featuredâ€™ Section

Comparatively different from other videos, the ones that are added under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ section are recommended to the audience throughout the YouTube platform on the basis of the algorithms that automatically determine which clips should be liked beach viewer individually.

To elaborate, generally, YouTube suggests you a video as per your viewing history, browsing statistics, and other such information that the streaming media giant collects over time. On the other hand, the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos are suggested according to what YouTube â€˜thinksâ€™ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a â€˜Featuredâ€™ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the â€˜Recommendedâ€™ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the â€˜Featuredâ€™ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PCâ€™s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as â€˜Featuredâ€™ after its approval.

![Publish Added Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-featured-section.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos arenâ€™t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding â€˜#Shortsâ€™ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channelâ€™s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channelâ€™s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.

## Part 1: Get More Views by Adding Shorts Video to the â€˜Featuredâ€™ Section

To elaborate, generally, YouTube suggests you a video as per your viewing history, browsing statistics, and other such information that the streaming media giant collects over time. On the other hand, the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos are suggested according to what YouTube â€˜thinksâ€™ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a â€˜Featuredâ€™ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the â€˜Recommendedâ€™ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the â€˜Featuredâ€™ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PCâ€™s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as â€˜Featuredâ€™ after its approval.

![Publish Added Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-featured-section.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos arenâ€™t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding â€˜#Shortsâ€™ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.
