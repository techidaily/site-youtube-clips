YouTube has had a video editor for a long time, but over time it has changed for the better. 2010 was when the first major overhaul happened, and since then more and more features have been added. There is still the question if the YouTube Video Editor is good, and if it replaces desktop editors. Hopefully, our YouTube Video Editor Review helps you figure out if you want to use the editor.

## YouTube Video Editor Review

**Note:** From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best [YouTube video editor alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from this complete guide.

In the early days of the [YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor), all you could do was trim video clips, arrange the clips on a timeline, add in basic transitions, and add music. Now the YouTube video editor is able to add video effects to the video and create multiple projects at the same time. While the editor can do more, it has stayed a simple tool.

This simplicity makes it very easy and quick to use. Unlike desktop editors, the YouTube Editor processes much faster. Since the tool is designed to be easy to use, you can learn to use the YouTube Editor in very little time. However, due to its simplicity, it does not offer all the same features. Some of the features that are missing means that it is not suited for every project.

#### **The Basic Features**

#### 1.The editor

The YouTube Video Editor does come with some standard video editing functions like video splicing, Audioswap, and cropping videos. The video editor needs to have the videos already uploaded to YouTube. Along with using your own videos, you have the option to use videos that are part of the Creative Commons library. There transitions, and other features that other standard video editors have. Audioswap is easy to use, and there is access to the Creative Commons library in the editor.

#### 2. The Enhancements

![YouTube video editor review](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg)

The Enhancements that are included in the YouTube Video Editor are not the best tools, but they are still pretty good overall. Enhancements can be found by clicking on a video picture after it has been added to the project. Enhancements are broken into four categories: Quick Fixes, Filters, Text, and Audio. Quick fixes are basic adjustments for small issues like the contrast and saturation of the video. YouTube added an auto-fix button and stabilize video button to make it quick to fix these issues. The filters, text, and audio, are about the same that you would find with any other video editing software.

**Related:** Want to know how to use the Enhancements feature in YouTube? Check this tutorial to know more: [How to use YouTube Enhancements.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### **Pros and Cons of the YouTube Video Editor**

The Pros of the YouTube Editor are that is it is free and has a huge library of free video clips and music. It is also super easy to learn. If you have a Google+ account, you can photos to your video straight from your cloud storage. You also have access to all the videos that you have uploaded to YouTube. All the features are easy to use, and many can be dragged and dropped making editing easy. Google is still improving the YouTube Video Editor to have more features and run smoother.

**Related:** Want to know YouTube alternatives? Check this article to know more: [YouTube Video Editor Alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The major con for YouTube Video Editor is that it only has the basic video editing features at the moment. Another major con is that the video editor is fully online. This means that a refresh is needed to see the changes that you have made. After the refresh of the video, the video jumps back to the beginning of the video making it frustrating to edit the end of a video. There is also no real way of shortening music in the editor at the moment. Unlike many desk top video editors, you cannot overlap music or video clips. This means that some of the transitions are choppy.

#### **The Bottom Line**

Since Google is still working on the YouTube Video Editor, hopefully, most of kinks will be worked out soon. While the YouTube Video Editor is getting better, it is still have the most basic features. The easy to use nature of the editor may mean that it stays more of a simple to use video tool. This does make it easy to edit, and it’s good for most projects. Millions of people use this editor because it is so easy to use. However, more advanced projects are still going to need a desktop video editor. We are hoping to see more advanced features in the future.

Many YouTubers and everyday people like the YouTube Video Editor, for its ease of use and the quick video editing that it provides. However, if it is right for you, depends greatly on what you are trying to do. If you plan on doing any editing past cropping videos, adding type and transitions, and switching music, you are better off using a desktop video editor. Hopefully, this YouTube Video Editor Review helps you figure out if YouTube’s editor is the right one of your projects.

## ImageSlice Cutter

Picsart is a platform that allows users to take photos and videos that they can then edit on the platform. Once the images or videos are edited to their satisfaction, users can then share them on each other’s social media pages.

It is one of the most popular media creation and editing apps with 1 billion uses around the world and it can be used on Android devices, iOS devices, and web browsers on PC. But Picsart is not a free solution and you may end up paying up to $48 a month to use the platform.

This is why we’ve searched for some of the most useful picsart alternatives that are completely free to use and work just as well.

## Picsart Photo and Video Editor

This app has more than 150 million downloads from users all over the world. It is available on the Google Play Store and offers numerous options to edit your photos and videos to create a more professional look and feel.

Some of the things that you can do using this app include creating collages, adding stickers, removing and even swapping backgrounds and so much more. You can edit existing images or use the built-in camera to take photos or record videos that you can then edit.

Here’s how you can use this app to edit your images or videos in numerous ways;

## Video Editor & Maker- Love Edit

Love-Edit is a mobile video editor that you can use to create professional videos that you can use for various purposes including marketing purposes. The tool has a simple user interface that can be used to make simple changes to a video such as cutting away sections of the video that you don’t want to include the video or even merging various clips to create a single video.

And since it is very easy to use, this tool can help you edit even the longest video in just a matter of minutes. But there are some users who complain that the app will begin lagging as soon as you start editing a video that is longer than 5 minutes.

Here’s how you can use this app to make changes to your videos;

Step 1: Start by installing the app on your device. Just go to the Google Play Store and search for the app. When you find it, tap “Install” to begin installing the app.

Step 2: Once installed, open the app and tap on the “+” icon or the “New Project” button to begin. Then select the video that you would like to edit.

In much the same way, you can add filters and even add additional images to the video. Do not forget to save the video once you are done with the editing process.

## iPhone Picsart Photo & Video Editor

The Picsart Photo & Video Editor for iOS is another great tool that you can use to edit photos and videos on your iPhone. It can be used to make simple changes to the photo or video such as adding a simple filter, but it is also a useful solution when you want to make significant changes to the photos or video such as removing backgrounds and replacing them with other images.

One of the things we love about this app is that you can use it to add text to an existing image or video and you have over 200 designer fonts to choose from. it also has a lot of effects to choose from for both images and videos. For images, you can choose from a large library of stickers to add to the image and for videos, you can add photos, music, and even trim the videos to the desired length.

Here’s how you can use this app to edit a video in various ways;

Step 1: If you don’t already have the app installed on your device, go to the App Store, search for it and install it on your device. If you already have it, make sure that you are running the latest version before using it.

Step 2: When the installation is complete, open the app and then click on the “+” icon to import the video that you would like to edit into the app. You can choose a video from your Photos app or any other source on your device.

Step 3: If you would like to add a filter to the video, tap “Effects” and then choose the filter that you would like to use. To add an image to the video, tap “Images” and then select the image that you would like to add. Resize the image to fit the screen.

## Conclusion

There are very many apps that you can use to edit photos and videos on your device. But most of them can be quite expensive. The options above are easy to use, cost-effective, and have the necessary features to help you easily edit your images and videos.
