If you want to increase the total number of subscribers that you have on your YouTube page it is important that your page is easy to subscribe to.

A subscribe link is a link to your channel page which takes the person who clicks it to the same view of the page they would have if they had already clicked to subscribe. It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.

A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.

## How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link

YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!

**Step 1:** Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.

**Step 2:** Add the following to the end of your channel URL:

?sub\_confirmation=1

**Step 3:** Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.

This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:

_<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w>_

That's a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor's YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:

_<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1>_

Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking. The process for creating a YouTube subscribe link is easy and accessible to everyone.

## Perfecting Proportions: Understanding YouTube Video Sizes

Yes, you are right. Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.

Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.

![youtube platform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg)

Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:

**Note:** YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar's white or grey/black area along the edges.

**●** YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop/PC Version:

If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video.

**●** YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:

There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.

## Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:
