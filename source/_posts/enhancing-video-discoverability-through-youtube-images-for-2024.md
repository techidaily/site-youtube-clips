# How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails

The art on your [YouTube channel](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) – banners, thumbnails, icons, and watermarks – will help to determine how viewers feel about your vlog. If your art does not look like it all goes together then people will get a sloppy, amateurish, impression of your channel. However, if your different pieces of channel art all seem to complement each other and match the tone and theme of your channel then it will help viewers to have a pleasant browsing experience. They will get the impression that you take your YouTube channel seriously and that they can trust you as a source of information, comedy, or general entertainment.

## How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails

YouTube Banners and Thumbnails are two of the most important pieces of channel art you will need. This article will explain the best practices for both, and suggest sites where you will be able to build your own banners and thumbnails for free.

#### 1\. YouTube Banners

**Quick Tips:**

1. The image you upload for your YouTube banner should be 2560 x 1440px (pixels).
2. The 'safe area' for text, logos, and other important visual information (like faces) is 1546 x 423px.

Your banner is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think about channel art. Banners are the headers that rest at the tops of channel pages on YouTube. Your banner should be 2560 x 1440 px, although not all of it will always be visible. On a desktop computer or mobile device only a 1546 x 423 px ‘safe area’ will be visible. When viewed on a TV screen your entire image will be visible. YouTube does support PNG, but if your PNG file does not upload properly (as has been the case for some YouTubers) then changing your file type to JPEG might help.

YouTube Banners are extremely important to the success of your channel. If you do not have a banner then it looks like you do not really care about your vlog. If you have a basic banner that is not at all personalized then it certainly looks like you care, but it might also look like you are new to YouTube.

The best banners are customized to reflect the kind of experience you want viewers to have on your channel. The banner of a comedic YouTube channel might use bright colors, where the banner for a gaming channel will probably use darker colors similar to the ones that are in the games the vlogger plays. Connecting your banner to the theme of your channel is part of how you define the style of your vlog. It is the difference between being a Beauty Guru and a general YouTuber who gives makeup tips sometimes.

Including a photo of yourself, or your logo if you have one, is a great way to personalize your banner.

#### 2\. YouTube Thumbnails

**Quick Tips:**

1. Search for your video's topic to see the thumbnails your thumbnail will be competing against.
2. Make any text huge so people can read it on their smartphone screens.
3. Emojis, colored boarders, and graphics are all potential ways to stand out.

Thumbnails are often ignored by newer YouTubers. YouTube selects a thumbnail for every one of your videos and it is always a still image from that video. You can choose which frame you want to use and a lot of people feel like that is good enough. When you create a custom thumbnail, however, you get to not only choose your image but insert a title.

If you are choosing the images you are using for thumbnails you can make sure they are always similar frames. This will help people identify your videos quickly in searches. Using titles in your thumbnails will also help searchers identify your videos, if you always use the same title style. Another benefit of titles is that they capture the attention of people looking for your specific topic. Remember when building your thumbnails that they will appear smaller on YouTube than they probably are while you edit them. On mobile devices, they will look even smaller. So, if you are going to use text in your thumbnail, make sure it is huge.

One thumbnail taboo that you should never break is using an image that has nothing to do with your video. Using an image of a cute cat for a vlog post that has nothing to do with cats is misleading and will anger viewers. You may draw in a lot of viewers who want to see a cat video, but they will leave right away when they do not see a cat and they will never watch anything by you again.

#### 3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails

There are sites online that will allow you to edit images and use them in templates for YouTube banners. You can also use these services to edit your thumbnails. Two of the most popular, free, online photo editors are PicMonkey.com and Canva.com.

![banner n thumb Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/banner-n-thumb-Canva.JPG)

**Canva** has templates you can use to create YouTube banners, as well as a variety of stock images you can use in combination with your own when creating channel art. It is free to edit images on Canva, but they do have some premium features which cost $1 each to access. This service has both a desktop version and an iPad app.

![banner n thumb PicMonkey](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/banner-n-thumb-PicMonkey.JPG)

**PicMonkey** lets you import images from your computer or social media accounts, edit them, and use them in templates for YouTube banners or other kinds of social media graphics. PicMonkey is free to use, but you can only access their more advanced editing tools if you buy a paid subscription. Monthly subscriptions are $4.99 per month, and yearly subscriptions are $2.75 per month.

Google Slide presentation is a powerful tool for creators to keep their audience engaged. This online platform lets you create and demonstrate your ideas. It will capture your viewers' attention from the very beginning. It also doesn't matter whatever learning style you engage. Adding YouTube videos to Google Slide will appeal to all levels of individuals.

More so, it is the best way to provide a break for both the audience and the creator. You can break Google Slide presentations with videos to offer some break. Viewers and the presenter get a breather in the process. The presenter can take a short break from speaking while the video plays. Let's now dive into **how to embed a YouTube video in Google Slides**.

![add youtube video to google slides](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-1.png)

#### In this article

01 [Why should we add a video to Google Slides?](#part1)

02 [How to add a YouTube video to Google Slide](#part2)

03 [How to choose the right video for your Slides?](#part3)

## Why should we add a video to Google Slides?

There is a great impact of adding video to Google Slides.

#### For attention

Videos will automatically awaken you, especially if your thoughts have started to sway during a presentation. A video has a direct way of showing creativity. The audience automatically connects the dots between the video and the presentation lines alike.

#### To stimulate discussion

A picture is worth a thousand words. There is a way that an added video will help the audience connect to the day's topic. It will bring up several ideas and stir up discussion with the presenter.

#### Easy following

With videos embedded in Google Slide, viewers will find it easy to understand and digest. Videos automatically eliminate boredom and make any topic interesting.

## How to add a YouTube video to Google Slide

Use these two methods to add a YouTube video to Google Slides. Via the Search and Direct link.

#### Method 1\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by search and selection

Google has owned YouTube since the year 2006\. You can, therefore, integrate Google's products with YouTube easily.

Step 1\. First, go to the slide where you want to embed your video.

Step 2\. Then choose the "Insert" option from the menu bar and hit the "Video" option.

![how to add youtube video to google slides](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-2.png)

Step 3\. It would be best if you now viewed the "YouTube" search bar to type in the video you want to embed. You can use keywords to search for the video in question and view instant search results.

Step 4\. Then select the video you want to embed, and you'll see it appear on the "Slide."

![how to add youtube video to google slides by search and selection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-3.png)

Step 5\. Format your video. Remember that the entire video will be embedded. You don't necessarily need the whole video. It is time to select just a brief but relevant clip from the video to use. Then position your video to the right point using the axes from the exact starting point to the finished part you want the video to appear in.

#### Method 2\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by direct link

You can engage this method if you want to include the entire video.

Step 1\. Get the URL of the specific YouTube video that you want to use.

![how to add youtube video to google slides by direct link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-4.png)

Step 2\. Then go to your browser's "Address bar" to copy the YouTube link.

Step 3\. Next, open the "Presentation" slide to put your video to.

Step 4\. Choose the "Insert" tab from the menu bar.

Step 5\. Then hit on the "Video" option from the drop-down menu that appears.

Step 6\. A new window will open automatically. Choose the "By URL" tab.

Step 7\. Then paste the YouTube video URL in the "Paste YouTube URL Here" bar section.

![add youtube video to google slides by direct link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-5.png)

Step 8\. Wait for the video file to load and press the "Select" option. The video will immediately appear in the presentation slide. Just drag and drop the video in your preferred position.

Note: You can do a few edits inside the application. Set the timer when your video should start and when to stop. You can also adjust the video player size.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.

#### Method 2\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by direct link

You can engage this method if you want to include the entire video.

Step 1\. Get the URL of the specific YouTube video that you want to use.

![how to add youtube video to google slides by direct link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-4.png)

Step 2\. Then go to your browser's "Address bar" to copy the YouTube link.

![add youtube video to google slides by direct link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-5.png)

Note: You can do a few edits inside the application. Set the timer when your video should start and when to stop. You can also adjust the video player size.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.
