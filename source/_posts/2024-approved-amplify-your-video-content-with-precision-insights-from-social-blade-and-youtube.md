Want to learn how to use **Social Blade** for YouTube? SocialBlade.com is a free-to-use website that displays your YouTube statistics – or the stats of any channel you are interested in – using an intuitive layout.

While many of the stats you can find on Social Blade are also available right on YouTube, some people find it easier to read on Social Blade. YouTube provides you with a lot of information, and a lot of it might not be useful to all creators.

## Your YouTube Analytics

![Social Blade for YouTube Analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-blade-youtube-analytics.jpg)

Social Blade is an excellent place to gauge the growth of your channel. It provides statistics on our subscribers, views, and estimated revenue.

To start using Social Blade, type your channel name into the search bar.

On the top section of the page, several stats will be clearly displayed.

First, you will see the letter grade assigned to your channel by Social Blade. If it is not a very good one, keep in mind that channels with over 10, 000 might still only receive Cs. Only YouTube megastars are getting As and Bs.

Next to your grade are your subscriber and video view ranks, as well as a rank assigned to you by Social Blade.

On the second line, you will see the views and subscribers you got in the last 30 days and the percentage by which you are up or down. Simply searching for yourself and glancing at this line is the easiest way to see whether your channel is growing, even easier than in your YouTube Creator Studio.

The final line of the first section will show you an estimate of your monthly revenue.

If you scroll down to the second section you will be able to see your views, subscribers, and estimated earnings per day rather than per month. Growth is in green and loss is in red.

By looking at this chart you can see which videos benefited your channel most after they were posted (your videos are not listed, but you can see based on the day you posted them). This will give you a good idea of what your audience wants to see.

## Spying on Other Channels

When you check your stats, you type your channel name into the search bar. If you want to use Social Blade to monitor somebody else’s stats, type their channel name instead.

By looking up your direct competitors (channels about the same size as yours within your same genre) you will be able to see which of their videos are performing best for them when you combine the daily information Social Blade provides with your knowledge of what videos they posted when.

Knowing what is working for your rivals will help you [design your content strategy](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

You can also use Social Blade to look up huge YouTube stars who you admire, just to see how well they are doing. Take their estimated revenue with a grain of salt, though – it’s just an estimate.

 That's how you can use Social Blade for YouTube - have you ever used it?

## Best YouTube Thumbnail Size

According to YouTube's help center, there are some things to remember when creating a thumbnail for your YouTube videos.

* First, make sure that the thumbnail size is 1280 pixels by 720 pixels and 640 pixels wide. It is the best YouTube thumbnail size.
* When it comes to the thumbnail dimension, make sure to use an aspect ratio of 16:9.
* Also, your YouTube thumbnail image should not exceed 2MB and is in either JPG, GIF or PNG format.

## How To Resize Your YouTube Thumbnail

The primary reason for changing the YouTube thumbnail size is to gain more audience. If you are a content creator, your main goal is to introduce your content to a wider range of viewers, right? So you have to pay attention to even the smallest detail, such as YouTube thumbnails to increase viewership and top YouTube SEO.

In fact, YouTube recommends this technique to get more viewers. Also, resizing your YouTube thumbnail will prevent you from getting the "file larger than 2MB error" which can cause your thumbnail to be discarded.

So, how can you use this technique? Check our tutorial below as we walk you through various recommended methods for resizing a YouTube thumbnail:

### Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App

The easiest way to resize YouTube thumbnails is through the Windows default app. Within just a few modifications, you can resize your thumbnail to fit as a preview image for your YouTube video.

Please take note that your image should be at least 2 megabytes or less to achieve the perfect YouTube thumbnail fit. If your image exceeds the limit, your thumbnail will either be rejected, or your image will have a black screen around it-which is not ideal at all.

Now, let us start the tutorial.

Step1 Open an image you want to set as a thumbnail. Then, **Right-click> Resize.**

![select image for youtube thumbnail resize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photo-for-youtube-thumbnail-resize.JPG)

Step2 Select "Define custom dimensions."

![youtube thumbnail custom dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-resize-dimensions.jpg)

Step3 Set the width to **1280** and the height to **720**. Then **tick** the box for "**Maintain Aspect Ratio** "and **click "Save Resized Copy."**

### Method 4\. Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software

In addition to using dedicated video editing software, several third-party image editing programs can be used to resize images for use as YouTube thumbnails. Programs like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) are popular for this purpose, as it offers a wide range of tools and features for editing and resizing images.

This program allows you to import an image, resize it to the dimensions required for a YouTube thumbnail (typically 1280 x 720 pixels), and save the edited version to your desired location. Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.

To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:

Step1 Install and **launch** GIMP on your computer.

Step2 Click on "**File**" > "**Open**," then search for the file you want to resize.

![gimp open thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG)

Step3 Click on "**Image**" > "**Scale Image**" and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.

![gimp edit resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG)

Step4 Click on "**File**" > "**Export As**" and **toggle** the "**Select File Type (By Extension)**" option. **Choose** JPG/JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.

Now that we've explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it's time to compare the pros and cons of each method. In this section, we'll consider factors such as ease of use, speed, quality, cost, and compatibility to help you determine the best option for your needs.

Take a look at the table below for a more detailed comparison.

| |  **Windows Default App**                         | **Online YouTube Thumbnail Size Converter** | **Wondershare Filmora** | **Third-Party Software** |          |

| **Internet Connection Required**                   | No                                          | Yes                     | No                       | No       |

| **File Size Limit**                                | None                                        | 25MB                    | None                     | None     |

Resizing YouTube thumbnails using the Windows default app is a quick and easy method that requires no additional software or tools. However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.

Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.

Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you're already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.

Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.

However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.

Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user's specific needs and preferences.

## Conclusion

This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP. Each method has advantages and disadvantages; the best one depends on your specific needs and preferences. No matter your chosen method, you can resize YouTube thumbnails confidently with these tools and techniques.
