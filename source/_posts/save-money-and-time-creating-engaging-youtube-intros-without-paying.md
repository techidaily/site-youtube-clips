A majority of people who can be called the target audience for YouTube Shorts are the artists and creators looking forward to getting noticed.

And of course, the viewers and subscribers cannot be left alone when talking about the target audiences of YouTube Shorts as without them, there’s no point in creating short videos in the first place.

The type of contents that the viewers expect to see as YouTube Shorts could include:
