### 3.YouTube Suggests

One of the most popular ways to find the best hashtags for YouTuber shorts is to write "#" into a YouTube search and once done it would show you hashtags that are the most used and trending ones. You can also type in "#a", "#b" etc. to find unique hashtag ideas.

### 4\. Create A Branded Hashtag

If you create branded hashtags and any users click on any of the hashtags, then the search results are dominated by your videos… not videos from other channels. So once you click on those hashtags you get a list of more videos from their channel.
