## Part 2: How to Make Video Intro in iMovie?

An important aspect of intro making is that it usually contains tile cards and opening credit info within the shot. The key is to find a YouTube intro maker that works best with the text and video edit both.

iMovie is a great program for editing simple yet high-impact on professional video intros. You can use the simple process outlined below to create your YouTube intro with iMovie.

**Step 1.** Open the interface and click on the menu displaying "File and Open project" to choose the video you want to attach the intro to.

**Step 2.** Click on the **Titles** tab on the right side of the interface and check for the black review box to appear.

**Step 3.** The customization bar for the effects you can place on your video will appear just under the black preview box. Experiment with the effects to get the perfect combination for your video.

**Step 4.** Type in the correct words in the text box below the effects bar. Different effects allow different space for phrases, so experiment with both effects and text until you get it right.
