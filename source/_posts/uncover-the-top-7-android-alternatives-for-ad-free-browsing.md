## Uncover the Top 7 Android Alternatives for Ad-Free Browsing

Developers make money by including ADS in their applications. They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.

Many people choose to use the free version since they can't afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely. Although most of the best ad blockers for android applications listed below work on browsers, you may need to root your Android smartphone to utilize some of them.

Let's get started with this article's list of the best ad blocker for android applications, which will help you get rid of the annoying ads you encounter in apps regularly.

## Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats

Ujjwal Chaurasia, alias Techno Gamerz, was born and grew up in New Delhi, India. The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018\. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother's phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234" border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![techno gamerz youtube marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg)

But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel's profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.

Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It's simple; via AdSense! YouTube's RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.

But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you'll earn at least $1,500\. **Techno Gamerz YouTube income** per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.

Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That's not all; you'll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube's payroll.

With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the **Techno Gamerz monthly income**, number of views, and more:

| Estimated Monthly earnings in USD/Indian rupees | $167K            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Estimated Yearly earnings in USD/Indian rupees  | $8.6 million     |
| Total video uploads                             | 858              |
| Type of videos                                  | Gaming tutorials |
| Subscribers                                     | 29 million       |
| Video views                                     | 7.5 billion      |
| Last 30 days' views                             | 7 million        |

As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on "ujjwalgamer." He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram.

He also has another Instagram account called "[Techno\_Gamerz](https://www.instagram.com/techno%5Fgamerz/)," which has over 1M followers and over 120K likes.

![techno gamerz youtube marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg)

But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel's profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.

Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It's simple; via AdSense! YouTube's RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.

But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you'll earn at least $1,500\. **Techno Gamerz YouTube income** per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.

Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That's not all; you'll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube's payroll.

With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the **Techno Gamerz monthly income**, number of views, and more:

| Estimated Monthly earnings in USD/Indian rupees | $167K            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Estimated Yearly earnings in USD/Indian rupees  | $8.6 million     |
| Total video uploads                             | 858              |
| Type of videos                                  | Gaming tutorials |
| Subscribers                                     | 29 million       |
| Video views                                     | 7.5 billion      |
| Last 30 days' views                             | 7 million        |

As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on "ujjwalgamer." He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram. Ujjwal's engagement rate on Instagram is around 12.5%.

![techno gamerz instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-3.jpg)

He also has another Instagram account called "[Techno\_Gamerz](https://www.instagram.com/techno%5Fgamerz/)," which has over 1M followers and over 120K likes. Ujjwal uses this account to keep his followers abreast of what's happening on his YouTube channel and give hints of future releases. He also posts subscriber milestones. His Twitter account is "[Ujjwal Chaurasia](https://twitter.com/UjjwalGamer)," with over 116K followers and around 290 posts.

![techno gamerz instagram and twitter homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-4.jpg)

Ujjwal is also venturing into music lately, specifically Hip Hop. He partnered with one of India's most prominent producers, Sez on the Beat, to release Game On. This music tells a tale of how Chaurasia started from zero subscribers to more than 10 million. Currently, this single boasts over 62 million views.
