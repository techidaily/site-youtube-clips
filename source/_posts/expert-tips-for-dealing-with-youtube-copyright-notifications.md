[YouTube copyright](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) rules might not always seem fair, but they are in place for a reason. If your YouTube videos get flagged for copyright issues relating to the background music or film clips it can be frustrating, especially if you receive a copyright notice for using royalty-free music you have a license for. Rather than feeling as though your creativity is being restrained, read this article to better understand the reasons copyright issues come up and what can be done to resolve them. Disputing copyright claims is something that any YouTuber can do.

* [What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One](#part1)
* [Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video](#part2)

## Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?

YouTube copyright issues often come up as a result of content ID claims. This will prompt Google support to deliver a copyright notice to your account. Content ID claims are generally made against content that contains material that should not be available on YouTube. Claims are often issued if you don't own the music, movie clips, TV clips, express rights to showcase cut scenes in video games, or other copyrighted media.

If you happen to see that a video has been muted or taken down you can visit the copyright notices section of your video manager to learn more. In this section you will learn more about what will be done as a result of the content ID claim.

Generally, a content ID claim does not put a YouTube channel in any kind of trouble. What usually happens is that the video is removed, you lose the ability to earn ad revenue from it, or the sound is muted so the copyrighted music no longer plays.

In some cases, the owner of the copyrighted content (usually musical artists) may choose to allow you to keep your video up in exchange for running their ads.

## Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video

If you have received copyright claims there are ways that you can get your content put back up in its original condition.

First, you could purchase the rights to use the copyrighted media after your video has been flagged or try getting express permission from the content creator to use aspects of their content in your own original video.

Sometimes, your videos may be flagged even though you've already purchased the license for the copyrighted music, images or clips you are using.

YouTube’s robots automatically scan through the database of audio and visual content that is put up by copyright owners. Any video that has been uploaded to YouTube with this copyrighted content will receive a third-party copyright notice. Because flagging happens automatically it often affects creators who have licenses for the royalty-free music, or other copyrighted material, they are using.

The good news is that this same level of protection will ensure that your own original content can also be protected from reuse if you register it.

In order to dispute a copyright claim on your video the first thing that you will need is some proof that you have purchased the rights to the music or other content that is being reused in your video. If you have a direct link to the online license agreement this can help with the dispute process. Purchasing a license online for royalty-free music or other content is usually fairly simple and with a PDF license certificate you can quickly dispute copyright content ID claims.

You can upload your license document to the file sharing system Dropbox to make the content public for YouTube admins to check over. Heading over to your video manager on YouTube and sending a message link with the dispute and link to your license will make sure that your explanation is heard. Sending the license, written permission, or a link to the legal license will result in YouTube reinstating your video.

Most of the time the only information that you need to use is where the license was purchased as well as the link to where the copyright license document can be accessed.

After submitting your dispute YouTube admins will often take a few business days to get back to you with an answer. There is no risk involved in disputing a copyright claim; your video has already been flagged. In the worst case scenario, your video will remain flagged.

Usually with the help of an official license or direct permission from the content creator you can file a dispute with YouTube and receive an answer. If the dispute process is successful your video will be reinstated to the original uploaded version without blocked sound or content.

Amidst many online applications is Twitch. This live streaming platform takes your experience to another level. You can use it to make crafts, play games, attract broadcasters, and many more. Twitch was launched in 2011, and since then, it has attracted millions of users, managing a database of about 4 million broadcasters by early 2020\. With it, users can stream their activities as others watch in real-time. Just browse a category to find a stream.

You can also follow streamers that you like on the platform and get updates and notifications immediately after they are posted. But how do you start a career on a platform like Twitch? You need to broadcast and gather a large following. You can use built-in audiences from other platforms like Facebook. Let's dive into the core of the matter and look at **how to upload Twitch streams to YouTube** and build your platform.

03 [How to upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube](#part3)

## What is Twitch VOD?

Twitch Video on Demand (VOD) is a recording of previously streamed content. It provides briefings if you missed catching the Twitch live stream. Just watch the VOD from your favorite streamer and be engaged the best way possible. However, VODs don't last forever. They are removed after two weeks of broadcast. But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.

#### \- How to enable Twitch VOD?

VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They'll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.

**Step 1\. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch**  
Check in the “Channel & Video” section and locate the “Stream Key & Preferences” menu.

![upload twitch stream to youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-2.png)

**Step 2\. Click on “Creator Dashboard”**  
Remember, you can enable VODs from your creator dashboard. Just go under the “Settings” tab and click on the “Stream section” of the creator dashboard. Check under the subtitle “VOD Settings” and get the option to store past broadcasts. You can also toggle the slider to store your past broadcasts.

![upload twitch stream to youtube - click on creator dashboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-3.png)

**Step 3 Click on the “Settings” tab on the left-hand side and go to Stream**  
You'll get various drop-down menu options. Click on the “Settings” tab and choose the “Stream” option. The system will navigate to a new page, thus setting your preferences for VODs and clips.

**Step 4\. Go to “VOD Settings” and toggle on the “Store Past Broadcast.”**  
Ensure you have the toggle option turned ON under the “VOD Settings.” If it's “ON,” you'll realize the toggle will be purple, with a checkmark in it. Twitch will be confirmed to be enabled if it's purple.

#### \- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD

These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.

##### 1\. How long will Twitch store my VOD

Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.

Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.

##### 2\. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips

Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don't need any additional requirements to use VOD.

Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.

* To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.
* Then scroll down and click on “Content” > “Video Producer.
* Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”
* Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”
* Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.
* Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.

When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.

The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer's channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.

* To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.
* Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.
* Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You'll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip's link to other social media networks.

## What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube

You stand to gain a lot when you upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube.

#### 1) To enlighten your followers

Your followers will see your streams and make the best decisions. Viewers can check out your recordings and other highlights from past streams. It will help them decide whether they like what they see and probably join your live streams.

#### 2) Twitch provides content for you to share and monetize on YouTube

Since Twitch streaming is more popular nowadays, many people throng it for content. It is not wise to rely entirely on Twitch to discover as a Twitch Streamer. Posting to YouTube will make it known within a short time. You would have announced your streams most nobly and kept your followers up to date, attracting new ones as well.

#### 3) To keep your followers engaged even when you are offline

Even though live streaming is important, some viewers may not attend the live sessions due to different time zones or other commitments. In this regard, when uploaded to YouTube, Twitch will give them a chance to watch your content just whenever they log in. They, therefore, have the option to watch a Twitch VOD of the live stream they missed.

## How to upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube

Check how to upload Twitch streams to YouTube from the Twitch website.

**Step 1.** Identify the little arrow next to your name on the Twitch website and click on it. Then click on the “Video Producer” to take you to a list of your Twitch videos.

![upload twitch stream to youtube - click on video producer on twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-5.png)

**Step 2.** Check out and click on the “three-dots” on the video you wish to upload to YouTube. Click on the “Export” tab.

**Step 3.** A menu will then pop up. Here, you can fill in the description, title, and tags that you would like to appear on the YouTube video. There is an option for Twitch to split your video automatically. If you wish so, then tick the “Checkbox” to enable it. Then click on the “Start Export” option to export your Twitch streams to YouTube.

#### \- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD

These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.

##### 1\. How long will Twitch store my VOD

Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.

Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.

##### 2\. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips

Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don't need any additional requirements to use VOD.

Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.

* To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.
* Then scroll down and click on “Content” > “Video Producer.
* Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”
* Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”
* Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.
* Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.

When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.

The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer's channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.

* To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.
* Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.
* Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You'll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip's link to other social media networks.
