## Part 1: What is YouTube affiliate marketing?

In YouTube affiliate marketing, videos are made to encourage customers to purchase products from third-party sites including Amazon.

When users buy products via your links, you can receive commission, which can be up to 10% depending on the category of the product and how much you are selling.

Examples of YouTube affiliate marketing videos include reviews, how-to guides, un-boxing videos and more. Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.

When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.

Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more. To make your marketing program successful, you must ensure people know about your video and encourage them to click on the links and buy the products.

Though this can seem daunting at first, the more experience you gain, the more revenue you can generate.

## Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project

### Step 1: build affiliate relationship

One of the first steps you should take when getting your project off the ground is to establish relationships with brands that you love. If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.

Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.

If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up. Chances are they will be more than happy to do so, as it could be very beneficial for them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Step 2: Create your product video

The next step is to actually produce your video. Viewers love honesty, so don’t be afraid to say so if there is a way you feel the product or service could be improved.

Remember to include calls to action. Un-boxing videos are very popular and show viewers everything inside a package, whilst review videos can also provide valuable insights.

Top 10 lists also generate high views. You must also remember to include a disclosure that informs viewers that you are being paid via an affiliate marketing scheme. This is a legal obligation.

![product video YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/product-video.JPG)

### Step 3: Promote your content

There are many things you can do to ensure your product is seen. Share your video on all your social media channels, respond to as many questions from viewers as possible and add links to online environments where the product is already being discussed.

Set up a channel that can be found when relevant search terms are used and make sure your titles are optimized for search too.

![promote YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote.JPG)

## Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin

### 1\. Commission Rate

All brands have different commission rates, with some offering up to 50% and others providing around 5%. Make sure you know what the rates are before you proceed and read the terms and conditions carefully. You may well wish to create a dedicated channel or channels to bring everything together. If you’re passionate about other people’s products, it makes perfect sense to get paid to talk about them.

![comission rate YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comission-rate.JPG)

### 2\. Where affiliate links appear

Affiliate links are placed below the YouTube video in the description. One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.

It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible. The more views you receive, the more favorably your content will be treated by YouTube.

![affiliate links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-links.JPG)

### 3\. Know your product well

It is really essential to know your product inside out when you are marketing it to viewers. YouTube viewers expect you to be an expert when it comes to the products you are showcasing, so take as much time as you need to gain an in-depth understanding of how it works and what its features are.

You must also be able to explain why it makes so much sense to choose the specific product or service over its competitors. Try not to be repetitive, use HD footage and a quality mic, avoid link spamming, choose the best kind of video for the product and plan out the video before you start creating it. Again, engage with your audience as much as you can.

# Best YouTube Video Reaction Ideas

## 10 Best YouTube Video Reaction Ideas You Should Try in 2021

The process of [making a YouTube video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) starts with an idea and the idea you choose often determines how good that video is going to be. The fact that reaction videos are so popular on YouTube right now, makes the idea selection even more important because just one good idea may boost your number of followers significantly. Here are some of the best video reaction ideas you can use to comment on different topics.

Music videos are among the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, which makes them perfect to react to.

### 2\. Video game reactions

Video games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto attract a lot of attention on YouTube, and if you are a fan of any of them you can easily react to the gameplay. Reacting to video games is only a good idea if your channel is dedicated to gaming, because otherwise, this reaction video idea may seem off-topic.

### 3\. React to video’s comments

YouTubers that already have thousands of followers need to keep coming up with new ways to engage their audience. Encouraging the viewers of your videos to comment on them can be a valuable source of ideas for reaction videos. You can comment on the topics that were discussed in the comments and address particular questions your followers have asked you.

### 4\. Make a ‘Kids React To’ videos

Videos of children reacting to different genres of music are already getting thousands of views every day.

There are so many different things children can react to, you just have to find a few that fit perfectly into your channel’s topic.

### 5\. React to ‘React To’ Videos

Even though reacting to a reaction video sounds silly, it is anything but because by doing so you will open up space for a dialogue with other YouTubers. Besides being funny, this is also an opportunity to give your two cents on topics that are most relevant for your channel. In addition, the YouTube audience loves collaborations between YouTubers, which will give you and your associates the opportunity to increase the size of your audience.

### 6\. Comment on your old videos

Producing new content for your YouTube channel regularly is important for so many reasons, but recycling old material from time to time can allow you to reflect on the topics you already covered. In addition, you’ll remind your viewers of your old videos and give them the reason to watch them again. Opting to comment on the videos you made in the past can also help you avoid potential copyright complications.

### 7\. Record reactions of elderly people

It becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the latest pop culture trends as we get older. That’s why elderly people often have trouble understanding the taste of younger generations. Recording their reactions to fashion choices young people make or the music they listen to can be hilarious, which makes it an excellent reaction video idea.

### 8\. React to different challenges

Over the course of the last decade, we’ve seen so many challenges go viral, as even the world’s most famous politicians took part in some of them. Challenge videos are not as popular as they used to be a few years ago, but they still amass thousands of views. Making funny reaction videos to different challenge videos may help you boost your number of followers, especially if you come up with witty remarks for each video you comment on.

### 9\. React to TV shows

We all love watching a good TV show, whether it is a TV series or a reality show. So, if you are looking for a reaction video idea that can hardly fail, commenting on a TV show may be the right choice for you. However, getting the right to use the footage you would like to comment on may be difficult, as making the reaction video without permission from the copyright owner may have legal implications.
