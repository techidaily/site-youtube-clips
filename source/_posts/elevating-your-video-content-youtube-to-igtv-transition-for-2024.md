Publishing video content on social media platforms like Instagram or IGTV can help influencers and brands reach new customers. The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise **video upload requirements**, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be **saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio**.

YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to **upload a YouTube video to IGTV** and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading. Because in this article, we are going to show you how you can convert a horizontal YouTube video into IGTV vertical one in 3 different ways.

In case you are working with a video that already has a 16:9 aspect ratio, you can create a project that has the same aspect ratio, and then just use **the Rotate slider in the Transform menu**, to change turn a landscape video into a portrait video. The scaling tool is helpful to enlarge the frames in a vertical aspect ratio.

![Filmora  convert YouTube to IGTV with transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-to-convert-youtube-igtv.jpg)

Filmora lets you create vertical videos in just a few quick steps, which makes it a perfect choice for influencers and marketers who want to share video content on YouTube and IGTV.

Latest News: In Filmora V10.5 and later versions, there is a new feature called Auto-Reframe. This feature allows users to convert one video for different social media platforms based on the aspect ratio changing, and its features of detecting the moving object. Click the Analyze button, and Filmora will convert this 16:9 YouTube video to vertical 9:16 IGTV video automatically. And I can adjust frames to follow Yasmine’s movement to fine-tune the result.

## Part 2: Use Kapwing to Convert YouTube to IGTV Online

YouTubers who already have lots of videos on their channel can use online video editing platforms, like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) to edit the content they want to post on IGTV. This online video editor offers a number of video editing tools that let you polish your videos before posting them on social media.

Click on the Resize tool and simply **copy and paste the URL** of a YouTube into the appropriate bar and the platform will **automatically import a video and display it on the screen** once the content is finally fetched.

![Kapwing  Crop YouTube video to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-crop-youtube-to-igtv.jpg)

Pick the **Story (Snap/Insta) or IGTV 9:16 option** and then proceed to **choose the background color for your IGTV video, increase or decrease the zoom level or change the position of the video**. Click on the **Create button** when ready and wait for Kapwing to process your video. **All videos you create with the free version of this online video editor are going to be watermarked** and you have to pay a six-dollar fee for each watermark-free video you edit with Kapwing or you can opt for a $20 monthly subscription fee that enables you to export an unlimited amount of videos without watermarks each month.

![Kapwing  Rotate YouTube video to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-convert-to-igtv.jpg)

A growing number of IGTV users choose to rotate their videos, instead of resizing them, so if you already have a YouTube video with a 16:9 aspect ratio you can just rotate it and get a video with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Click on the **Rotate**  option and then rotate it **90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise** and click on the **Create button**. If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.

## Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro

Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to **set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio**. During the video editing process, you will have to **resize all of the footage** you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.

If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.

**Conclusion**

Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV? Leave a comment and let us know.

![Kapwing  Rotate YouTube video to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-convert-to-igtv.jpg)

A growing number of IGTV users choose to rotate their videos, instead of resizing them, so if you already have a YouTube video with a 16:9 aspect ratio you can just rotate it and get a video with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Click on the **Rotate**  option and then rotate it **90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise** and click on the **Create button**. If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.

## Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro

Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to **set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio**. During the video editing process, you will have to **resize all of the footage** you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.

If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.

**Conclusion**

Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV? Leave a comment and let us know.

Publishing video content on social media platforms like Instagram or IGTV can help influencers and brands reach new customers. The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise **video upload requirements**, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be **saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio**.

YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to **upload a YouTube video to IGTV** and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading. Because in this article, we are going to show you how you can convert a horizontal YouTube video into IGTV vertical one in 3 different ways.

It is significant for a business to stay connected to its customers and videos are a wonderful medium to build that connect! Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube.

There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!

* [Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion](#part1)
* [Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion](#part2)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion

![dailymotion-uploading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-uploading.jpg)

Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video.
