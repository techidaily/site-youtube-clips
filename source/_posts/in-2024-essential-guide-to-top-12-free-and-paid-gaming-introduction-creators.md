These YouTubers have a passion for a particular niche. For example, film production, kid's shows, music, and so on. It seems they are talented in those areas of choice, and much focus is on how to better them.

**Engage with your audience**  
This is a crucial part if you want to be a successful YouTuber. These top 10 creators have shown that engaging with their audience has a great impact on the outcome of their production.

**They have executed channel trailers**  
Another common similarity with these top 10 YouTubers is the use of channel trailers features. You get short trailers that automatically play when a viewer lands on the YouTube channel page. These should, however, be short and give viewers a welcoming feeling to stay along.

**Call To Action**  
The reason why these content creators stay ahead is the urge to continue getting more subscribers. These channels have well-illustrated avenues for more potential subscribers. More so, they have several elements at the end-screen.

**They earn**  
Their YouTube channels are making some good bucks for them. It is estimated that PewDiePie makes about $10 million per year from his YouTube channel, while Justin Bier gets about $9 million from YouTube advertising.

## Additional thoughts - the importance of a well-made video

A well-made video is all you need to make an impact on your YouTube channel journey.

* It automatically boosts conversions and sales by engaging your viewers. In no time, this will directly lead to sales.
* Content marketing involves building trust to create a long-term relationship. A good video will let people come to you because they know you got value, just as the video attests.
* It is a perfect form of igniting emotions and engaging your viewers. So, better give them quality content.
* Videos are good platforms for viewers to learn in detail. For example, a tutorial video will show clearly the steps to follow for a particular project until success.
* If you want your content to be widely accessed, then use a video to encourage social shares. Any good content will automatically find its way into the social world via shares among friends.

Step 2\. Create a new project  
If you don’t have any project you were using before, you can create a new one. Click the “New Project” option and wait for the editor to load. Also, ensure to register your product by clicking the “Register” button. Then go to the “Project settings” option and select the aspect ratio to use.

Step 3\. Import the footage

Step 4\. Organize your material  
Then begin to organize the files you have imported. You can create and use folders to sort out your files from the “My Album” section. Just click on the “Add a New Folder” icon to create a folder and rename it. Then arrange your footage as you wish.

Step 5\. Move your videos to the timeline  
Here is where you can edit your videos freely. Use the drag and drop feature to add them. You can also rearrange your files by dragging the files to the desired position in the timeline. You can then preview your videos by clicking the “Play” tab or using the “Playhead” to jump to a certain portion of the video.

Step 6\. Edit video  
Filmora lets you add effects and modify your video to your satisfaction. You can trim by dragging the end of a video clip on the right or left side. Likewise, you can apply other visual effects like insert transitions, add music, or even detach the audio and video to put background music of choice. More so, it’s easy to add text like opening titles, end credits, and so on to your video. Engage the available templates by dragging and dropping that of your choice to the timeline. Then add the appropriate text in Filmora’s preview window.

Step 7\. Export and Share
