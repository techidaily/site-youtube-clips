## Part 2. Online YouTube MP3 Converters for Mac

There are several online applications that allow you to convert YouTube videos to MP3s. Two of the best are:

### Conversion Method 1: YouTube MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube MP3](https://ytmp3.cc/youtube-to-mp3/) is designed with simplicity in mind: you simply paste the YouTube URL into the field and click the “Convert Video” button and the YouTube MP3 website takes care of the rest. When the conversion is complete, you can download your MP3 file from their servers.

* **Pros**: No account needed, free-to-use, compatible with all devices and formats
* **Cons**: Requires fast and reliable online connection, takes 3-4 minutes per video

### Conversion Method 2: YouTube in MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube in MP3](https://yt1s.com/youtube-to-mp3/en3) is very similar to the above application, although it offers several appealing extra features. Paste in your URL and click, and the program does the work quickly – your download will be ready in seconds. This service works on computers, smartphones and tablets, in a variety of formats.

* **Pros**: No account or sign up necessary, free-to-use, offers low-, standard-, and high-quality output, edit MP3s online prior to download
* **Cons**: Requires a very good online connection, lacks more advanced editing and format features of a YouTube MP3 converter for Mac program

### Conversion Method 1: YouTube MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube MP3](https://ytmp3.cc/youtube-to-mp3/) is designed with simplicity in mind: you simply paste the YouTube URL into the field and click the “Convert Video” button and the YouTube MP3 website takes care of the rest. When the conversion is complete, you can download your MP3 file from their servers.

* **Pros**: No account needed, free-to-use, compatible with all devices and formats
* **Cons**: Requires fast and reliable online connection, takes 3-4 minutes per video

### Conversion Method 2: YouTube in MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube in MP3](https://yt1s.com/youtube-to-mp3/en3) is very similar to the above application, although it offers several appealing extra features. Paste in your URL and click, and the program does the work quickly – your download will be ready in seconds. This service works on computers, smartphones and tablets, in a variety of formats.

* **Pros**: No account or sign up necessary, free-to-use, offers low-, standard-, and high-quality output, edit MP3s online prior to download
* **Cons**: Requires a very good online connection, lacks more advanced editing and format features of a YouTube MP3 converter for Mac program
