It is no secret that the iPhone and the iPad are the most popular smartphone and tablet respectively. You could argue that Samsung has impressive sales and is almost at par with Apple but in regards to sheer dominance or superiority, the South Korea based conglomerate bows down to the American tech juggernaut. YouTube is indisputably the most popular video hosting and sharing site in the world. It doesn’t help that YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine giant that also owns Android which powers all popular Samsung smartphones at the moment. As a result, what you get is a tad incompatible with YouTube and iPhone or iPad. Downloading YouTube videos is very simple if you are using an Android smartphone or a Windows computer. It is not so when you are using an iPhone, iPad or even a Mac.

Fortunately, there are ways you can download YouTube videos to iPhone or iPad, and we aren’t talking about YouTube’s promise of offline video streaming. Here is a complete guide.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

### First, you need a video downloader

You need a third party app which is approved by Apple and available in App Store. There are quite a few free video downloader apps that you can check. But do make sure that the app is active or usable right now. Apple is a tad infamous for deleting some of the apps from its store from time to time. If that happens after you have installed and started using a video downloader, then you can just remove it and opt for another. Most of these free video downloader apps will save your videos within the app. Some would add them to the videos in your Camera Roll. You can use AirPlay to watch the videos if you have an Apple TV. The videos saved by downloader apps will not be found in the native Videos app of iPhone or iPad. When you search for such apps, use ‘video downloader’ or ‘YouTube downloader’ as the keywords.

### Find a suitable app, download it for free and install it

Some of the downloader apps will have premium or pro versions. You don’t need to pay before you have used the free or basic version. Once installed, start the app. Most of these apps have a built-in browser which should allow you to access YouTube. In most cases, you would get to m.youtube.com. If there is no default address, then save the mobile version of YouTube as the default URL. On iPad, you can go for <www.youtube.com>.

### Downloading Youtube videos to iPhone or iPad

In all likelihood, you are familiar with how YouTube works. Search for a video that you wish to download, pick the one you want from the search results and it would automatically start to play. In some cases, you may have to click the play button or tap on the video thumbnail for it to start playing. As the video begins to stream or buffer, you would find an icon of the app, usually bobbing or hovering over the screen playing the video. You can tap on this icon, which could be a disk sign or the logo of the app. As you tap on it, you would have a popup that will prompt you to download the video that you are watching.

![download youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-videos.jpg)

Depending on the app you are using, the download may begin immediately after tapping on the download icon or there can be another step, which will perhaps show you the list of downloading videos or videos that you have downloaded already. If the download doesn’t start immediately, there could be another button to initiate the download. Tap on it and you are done. The download would be automated and you don’t need to do anything else. You can also have your iPhone or iPad in sleep mode and the download would be completed, as long as there is an active internet connection. You can also see the progress made. Once the download or downloads are complete, you would get a notification. The video downloaded would be within the app’s video library or in your files.

Some apps rename the videos that are being downloaded so it is best you opt for a title or a name that will help you to recognize the video immediately. Other apps will keep the name of the video that appears on YouTube.

![download youtube videos on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-videos-on-iphone.jpg)

Almost all video downloader apps for iPhone and iPad will allow you to watch these videos offline. Some apps may need an internet connection to open but the videos saved will not require any internet to be played and replayed.

Given the fact that there are many video downloader apps and you cannot be sure of the experience of any, you will have to indulge in a bit of trial and error to find the best one.

* **Channel Memberships**: Viewers to pay a monthly fee to support your channel. In exchange, they get unique perks like early access to new videos
* **Merchandise Shelf**: YouTubers with more than 10,000 subscribers can enable a merch shelf. It allows them to sell merchandise on videos.
* **Super Chat**: You can also earn money from YouTube through Super Chat and Super Stickers. They allow viewers to pay for their messages to be highlighted in the live chat. They can also pay for the animated images that appear on the screen.
* **Brand Deals**: YouTubers partner with brands to promote products or services. Brand deals can also include sponsorships and product placement.

The YouTube policy for monetization through ad revenue will remain the same. Channels are still required to have at least 1,000 subscribers with more than 4,000 public watch hours for long videos in the past 365 days or 10M public views for Shorts videos in the past 90 days.

![updated old standards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-3.JPG)

That said, the 2023 new YouTube monetization requirements are a great addition to creators’ journey. Creators who have applied for early access to fun funding are not required to reapply after qualifying for full monetization.

* **Copyright Guidelines:** Content must not infringe on the copyright of others, including music or videos without permission.
* **Monetization Policies:** Content must not be designed to manipulate viewers into clicking on ads or performing other actions intended to generate revenue for the creator.

## **Part 3\. How YouTube's New Monetization Policy Will Impact Creators**

This implies that more creators can monetize their channels. By attaining YouTube monetization eligibility quickly, small YouTubers will now be motivated to create content with more value.

### **Who Benefits the Most from YouTube Monetization Rules 2023**

Ad revenue is the most sustainable form of monetization. Creators don’t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.

![shorts revenue sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG)

Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have. So, the new policy will allow YouTubers will a low following to earn from streaming their content. Short creators will benefit from the high number of views shorts tend to generate.

### **New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.

### **Advertisers to Benefit**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.

### **Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels**

The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.

It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators.

* **Channel Memberships**: Viewers to pay a monthly fee to support your channel. In exchange, they get unique perks like early access to new videos
* **Merchandise Shelf**: YouTubers with more than 10,000 subscribers can enable a merch shelf. It allows them to sell merchandise on videos.
* **Super Chat**: You can also earn money from YouTube through Super Chat and Super Stickers. They allow viewers to pay for their messages to be highlighted in the live chat. They can also pay for the animated images that appear on the screen.
* **Brand Deals**: YouTubers partner with brands to promote products or services. Brand deals can also include sponsorships and product placement.

### **Applicability of the Old Standards**

The YouTube policy for monetization through ad revenue will remain the same.

![updated old standards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-3.JPG)

That said, the 2023 new YouTube monetization requirements are a great addition to creators’ journey. Creators who have applied for early access to fun funding are not required to reapply after qualifying for full monetization.

### **Additional Policies and Guidelines**

Apart from the new monetization rules for YouTube 2023, other policies and guidelines remain the same. Youtubers are required to adhere to the following YouTube channel monetization policies:

* **Content Guidelines:** Content must not violate YouTube’s Community Guideline. YouTubers are prohibited from uploading violent or harmful content.
* **Copyright Guidelines:** Content must not infringe on the copyright of others, including music or videos without permission.
* **Monetization Policies:** Content must not be designed to manipulate viewers into clicking on ads or performing other actions intended to generate revenue for the creator.

## **Part 3\. How YouTube's New Monetization Policy Will Impact Creators**

The new monetization rules for YouTube 2023 create a unique opportunity for creators to make money. The requirements to get monetized on YouTube are now relaxed. This implies that more creators can monetize their channels. By attaining YouTube monetization eligibility quickly, small YouTubers will now be motivated to create content with more value.

### **Who Benefits the Most from YouTube Monetization Rules 2023**

Ad revenue is the most sustainable form of monetization. Creators don’t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.

![shorts revenue sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG)

Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have. So, the new policy will allow YouTubers will a low following to earn from streaming their content. Short creators will benefit from the high number of views shorts tend to generate.

### **New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.

### **Advertisers to Benefit**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.

### **Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels**

The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.

It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.
