So, if you're ready to **convert Spotify playlists to YouTube Music**, let's get started!

![gostream-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gostream-poster.png)

GoStream, one of the best sites like FMovies, is the last entry on our list. As with the other sites described above, this one focuses on providing you with the most recent movies for free, with a preview and an IMDb rating for each one of them.

As a bonus, the videos load quickly and you don't need a username or password to begin watching. Only a few redirections are included in this site's advertising. Before you begin streaming, we suggest that you verify the quality of the movie, since some on the site are of low quality.

**Features:**

* One focuses on providing you with the most recent movies for free
* Videos load quickly and you don't need a username or password to begin watching
