YouTube is forever recommending videos for you whether it's in your dashboard or next to the video you're already watching. In theory, these recommendations are based on your viewing habits and you're only directed to videos you're interested in.

Except we all know that’s not always what happens.

YouTube’s recommendations are based on more than just what you’ve watched and searched for, and sometimes even the data on that can get skewed over time. Not all your searches reflect your real tastes, and as your search history builds up the algorithm can start having trouble with all that data.

Here’s what you can do about it:

1. [**Manage Your Watch History**](#manage)
2. [**Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested**](#notinterested)
3. [**But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?**](#butwhy)

## Manage Your Watch History

![Manage Watch History](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-watch-history.jpg)

Scroll to the bottom of any page on YouTube and you will see a button marked **History** with an hourglass icon. To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the **Account** tab and tap **History**.

You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.

If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh. Maybe your tastes have changed since YouTube started keeping track of them.

## Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested

![Tell YouTube Not Interested](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tell-youtube-not-interested.jpg)

Based on your watch history, YouTube knows what you like. However, they have no way of automatically collecting data on what kinds of videos you’d rather not see.

What they do have is a system for you to flag recommendations you don’t like.

Hover over the thumbnail of a video you don’t want to be recommended to you and a small icon that looks like three stacked dots will appear next to the title. Click on that, and then click **Not Interested**.

When you tell YouTube you aren’t interested in certain videos they use that data to adjust what they recommend for you.

## But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?

Your search/watch history is not the only thing that determines what YouTube recommends for you. Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch **time**.

Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn't closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you'll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that'll keep you around.

  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.

The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.

 Are you usually happy with YouTube's recommended videos?

## What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?

## Best 5 Video Editing Platforms That Don't Feature in YouToo

# Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

YouTube provides a free tool that allows the user to create a video by putting together various clips and then publish them with a single click. All the uploads that the user has made before are added to the YouTube Video Editor. The tool allows the user to combine, trim, add music and customize. However, its functionality is limited to just that, and that's why people are looking for the best YouTube Video Editor alternative.

**Note:** From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best [YouTube video editor alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from this complete guide.

Some of the cons of the YouTube Video Editor are:

* It doesn't have advanced editing features.
* It requires Internet connection to use.
* It is slow.
* Users can only edit videos that were already uploaded to their YouTube account.

## Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives

The good news is that there are good offline YouTube Video Editor Alternatives out there. Below are the top five:

#### 1\.  Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the most popular YouTube Video Editor alternatives. It is available for both Windows and Mac platforms. The best thing about Wondershare Filmora is that it is easy to use. And at the same time, it has more features than the YouTube Video Editor.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Some of the key features of Filmora include:

* Allows the user to crop, cut, and combine video clips in just a few clicks
* Supports the addition of multiple audio and video tracks
* Choose from various overlays and filters
* Supports face off, green screen, and PIP effects
* Supports a wide range of video formats that include MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WMV, just to name a few
* Burn video to DVD, or instantly upload it to YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo

#### 2\.  WeVideo

Another YouTube Video Editor alternative is [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/). It is a cloud-based video editor that allows the user to do the editing in any web browser. Just like the YouTube editing tool, the user must first upload the clips online in order to edit them, and create a video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bdayvideo-wevideo.jpg)

 **Pros:**

One advantage of WeVideo is that it allows different users to collaborate in making a single video. A user can invite others to upload clips to the project, or even make different videos based on the same clips.

 **Cons:**

And because it is a cloud-based video editor, it requires an Internet connection in order to get the clips and do the editing. Not only that, the videos must be uploaded before they can be used. And there are cases in which a five-minute video will require hours of raw footages. Users with slow upload speeds will take hours before they can start editing. And users of the free version can only export 480p videos that have a watermark. Users need to pay for the full version.

#### 3\. Loopster

[Loopster](http://www.loopster.com/) is a mobile app that can be a YouTube Video Editor alternative. It is available for both the Android and iOS platforms. The tool allows the user to rotate, splice and add sound effects, zoom, and crop videos directly from one's smartphone. It comes with advanced features that include title screens, slow motion effect, and bubble text. The app also lets the user record video and sounds directly. After editing the video, the app can export it directly to Facebook or YouTube.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loopster.jpg)

 **Pros:**

It does what it was designed to do when it is working. It is user-friendly and comes with a tutorial. It also works even if the smartphone is not connected to the internet. Editing is done offline. And best of all, it is free.

 **Cons:**

One the downside, it looks like the developer is no longer updating the app. Some users experience crashes and other bugs. There are also some users that stated that the slow motion effect didn't work for them, which is why they can't recommend it as a YouTube Video Editor alternative.

#### 4\. Tubechop

[Tubechop](https://www.tubechop.com/) allows the user to trim a video from any YouTube video and then share it. There are some videos that are just too long, and you want to cut it to the section that you find interesting.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubechop.jpg)

 **Pros:**

Just like the other YouTube Video Editor alternatives, Tubechop is easy to use. The user just needs to enter the YouTube URL of the video, and then indicate the section that's interesting, and that's it.

 **Cons:**

However, Tubechop doesn't allow users to download the resulting video. Tubechop only provides a link that allows users to view the chopped video. And when the original video is deleted, the chopped version will also be deleted.

#### 5\. Viddyad

[Viddyad](https://viddyad.com/) is another cloud-based platform that lets users convert images, music, clips, and animated effects into a video. It is said to be the best way to create video ads for businesses.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viddyad.jpg)

 **Pros:**

There are several templates to choose from. Users can create video ads by adding videos, text, voiceover, special effects, music, and images. The platform also provides access to millions of image and video stock.

 **Cons:**

Viddyad is a YouTube Video Editor alternative for businesses that want to create video ads. It might not be the right video editor for individuals who just want to create and share their personal videos.

All the uploads that the user has made before are added to the YouTube Video Editor. The tool allows the user to combine, trim, add music and customize. However, its functionality is limited to just that, and that's why people are looking for the best YouTube Video Editor alternative.

**Note:** From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best [YouTube video editor alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from this complete guide.

Some of the cons of the YouTube Video Editor are:

* It doesn't have advanced editing features.
* It requires Internet connection to use.
* It is slow.
* Users can only edit videos that were already uploaded to their YouTube account.

## Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives

The good news is that there are good offline YouTube Video Editor Alternatives out there. Below are the top five:

#### 1\.  Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the most popular YouTube Video Editor alternatives. It is available for both Windows and Mac platforms. The best thing about Wondershare Filmora is that it is easy to use. And at the same time, it has more features than the YouTube Video Editor.

#### 2\.  WeVideo

Another YouTube Video Editor alternative is [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/). It is a cloud-based video editor that allows the user to do the editing in any web browser. Just like the YouTube editing tool, the user must first upload the clips online in order to edit them, and create a video.

 **Pros:**

One advantage of WeVideo is that it allows different users to collaborate in making a single video. A user can invite others to upload clips to the project, or even make different videos based on the same clips.

 **Cons:**

And because it is a cloud-based video editor, it requires an Internet connection in order to get the clips and do the editing. Not only that, the videos must be uploaded before they can be used. And there are cases in which a five-minute video will require hours of raw footages. Users with slow upload speeds will take hours before they can start editing. And users of the free version can only export 480p videos that have a watermark. Users need to pay for the full version.

#### 3\. Loopster

[Loopster](http://www.loopster.com/) is a mobile app that can be a YouTube Video Editor alternative. It is available for both the Android and iOS platforms. The tool allows the user to rotate, splice and add sound effects, zoom, and crop videos directly from one's smartphone. It comes with advanced features that include title screens, slow motion effect, and bubble text. The app also lets the user record video and sounds directly. After editing the video, the app can export it directly to Facebook or YouTube.

 **Pros:**

It does what it was designed to do when it is working. It is user-friendly and comes with a tutorial. It also works even if the smartphone is not connected to the internet. Editing is done offline. And best of all, it is free.

 **Cons:**

One the downside, it looks like the developer is no longer updating the app. Some users experience crashes and other bugs. There are also some users that stated that the slow motion effect didn't work for them, which is why they can't recommend it as a YouTube Video Editor alternative.

#### 4\. Tubechop

[Tubechop](https://www.tubechop.com/) allows the user to trim a video from any YouTube video and then share it. There are some videos that are just too long, and you want to cut it to the section that you find interesting.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubechop.jpg)

 **Pros:**

Just like the other YouTube Video Editor alternatives, Tubechop is easy to use. The user just needs to enter the YouTube URL of the video, and then indicate the section that's interesting, and that's it.

 **Cons:**

However, Tubechop doesn't allow users to download the resulting video. Tubechop only provides a link that allows users to view the chopped video. And when the original video is deleted, the chopped version will also be deleted.

#### 5\. Viddyad

[Viddyad](https://viddyad.com/) is another cloud-based platform that lets users convert images, music, clips, and animated effects into a video. It is said to be the best way to create video ads for businesses.
