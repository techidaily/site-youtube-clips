Have you ever listened to a YouTube video on max volume but still the sound wasn’t audible - even after turning up the YouTube volume as well as device audio? It is super annoying and inconvenient when you increase volume to max yet the video remains inaudible. YouTube volume issue could be due to various reasons such as poor audio quality of the built-in speakers or low original video sound.
