There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok. Even though Tiktok's operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app 'VINE' was shut down back in 2016.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms.

Further, we feel that differences in posting (such as formats, [aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and durations) should be accounted for when YouTube videos are converted into TikTok videos.

## Part 1: How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?

There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok. Even though Tiktok's operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app 'VINE' was shut down back in 2016.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post.

[Auto Reframe](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as clear from the name, can automatically visualize and detect the video's focal point to resize or crop it in an optimal way. The Auto Reframe tool can identify a moving item in any video and rapidly trim it to multiple aspect ratios. What initially took hours, if not days, of editing may now be completed in moments with Filmora. You can also manually set the focal point in any video to adjust the aspect ratio and preferences as per your choice.

If you frequently have to upload videos to your social networking networks such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, Filmora will ease your life! We'll teach you how to utilize Filmora's Auto-Reframe option to reframe sequences for your **YouTube to TikTok videos** in the below-listed steps.

Step 1: Start by **Launching Filmora** on your device. Choose the Auto Reframe option from the starting window.

You can choose from **five different aspect ratios**: square (1:1), vertical (9:16), standard (4:3), widescreen (16:9), and cinema (21:9). You can also adjust the **frame's dimensions** by moving the crop box.
