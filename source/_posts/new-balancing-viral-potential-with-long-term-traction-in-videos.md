## Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking

If you are a YouTuber, you have to understand how videos rank higher. In turn, this will allow you to ensure your content appears in top search results more often. With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.

#### Video Title

![factors that affect youtube video ranking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png)

YouTube videos number in the many millions. Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.

On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.

A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.

Video titles should have five words or less. Don't forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.

#### Video Description

![factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png)

When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.

Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won't know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.

Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.

When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.

#### Video Quality

Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.

Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.

What's more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.

#### Watch Time

![factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png)

Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.

YouTube's algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly

Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.

#### Thumbnails

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png)

Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.

YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.

Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.

#### Number of Views

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png)

Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.

If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.

You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.

#### Closed Captions and Subtitles

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png)

Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.

While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.

## How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking

#### Focusing on User Engagement

One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.

#### Using Video Hashtags

Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.

Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.

#### Categorizing Your Video

After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.

## Conclusion

With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging. But by paying attention to the above YouTube ranking factors, you can improve your video ranking.

YouTube provides a free tool that allows the user to create a video by putting together various clips and then publish them with a single click. All the uploads that the user has made before are added to the YouTube Video Editor. The tool allows the user to combine, trim, add music and customize. However, its functionality is limited to just that, and that's why people are looking for the best YouTube Video Editor alternative.

**Note:** From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best [YouTube video editor alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from this complete guide.

Some of the cons of the YouTube Video Editor are:

* It doesn't have advanced editing features.
* It requires Internet connection to use.
* It is slow.
* Users can only edit videos that were already uploaded to their YouTube account.

## Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives

The good news is that there are good offline YouTube Video Editor Alternatives out there. Below are the top five:

#### 1\.  Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the most popular YouTube Video Editor alternatives. It is available for both Windows and Mac platforms. The best thing about Wondershare Filmora is that it is easy to use. And at the same time, it has more features than the YouTube Video Editor.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Some of the key features of Filmora include:

* Allows the user to crop, cut, and combine video clips in just a few clicks
* Supports the addition of multiple audio and video tracks
* Choose from various overlays and filters
* Supports face off, green screen, and PIP effects
* Supports a wide range of video formats that include MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WMV, just to name a few
* Burn video to DVD, or instantly upload it to YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo

#### 2\.  WeVideo

Another YouTube Video Editor alternative is [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/). It is a cloud-based video editor that allows the user to do the editing in any web browser. Just like the YouTube editing tool, the user must first upload the clips online in order to edit them, and create a video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bdayvideo-wevideo.jpg)

 **Pros:**

One advantage of WeVideo is that it allows different users to collaborate in making a single video. A user can invite others to upload clips to the project, or even make different videos based on the same clips.

 **Cons:**

And because it is a cloud-based video editor, it requires an Internet connection in order to get the clips and do the editing. Not only that, the videos must be uploaded before they can be used. And there are cases in which a five-minute video will require hours of raw footages. Users with slow upload speeds will take hours before they can start editing. And users of the free version can only export 480p videos that have a watermark. Users need to pay for the full version.

#### 3\. Loopster

[Loopster](http://www.loopster.com/) is a mobile app that can be a YouTube Video Editor alternative. It is available for both the Android and iOS platforms. The tool allows the user to rotate, splice and add sound effects, zoom, and crop videos directly from one's smartphone. It comes with advanced features that include title screens, slow motion effect, and bubble text. The app also lets the user record video and sounds directly. After editing the video, the app can export it directly to Facebook or YouTube.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loopster.jpg)

 **Pros:**

It does what it was designed to do when it is working. It is user-friendly and comes with a tutorial. It also works even if the smartphone is not connected to the internet. Editing is done offline. And best of all, it is free.

 **Cons:**

One the downside, it looks like the developer is no longer updating the app. Some users experience crashes and other bugs. There are also some users that stated that the slow motion effect didn't work for them, which is why they can't recommend it as a YouTube Video Editor alternative.

#### 4\. Tubechop

[Tubechop](https://www.tubechop.com/) allows the user to trim a video from any YouTube video and then share it. There are some videos that are just too long, and you want to cut it to the section that you find interesting.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubechop.jpg)

 **Pros:**

Just like the other YouTube Video Editor alternatives, Tubechop is easy to use. The user just needs to enter the YouTube URL of the video, and then indicate the section that's interesting, and that's it.

 **Cons:**

However, Tubechop doesn't allow users to download the resulting video. Tubechop only provides a link that allows users to view the chopped video. And when the original video is deleted, the chopped version will also be deleted.

#### 5\. Viddyad

[Viddyad](https://viddyad.com/) is another cloud-based platform that lets users convert images, music, clips, and animated effects into a video. It is said to be the best way to create video ads for businesses.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viddyad.jpg)

 **Pros:**

There are several templates to choose from. Users can create video ads by adding videos, text, voiceover, special effects, music, and images. The platform also provides access to millions of image and video stock.

 **Cons:**

Viddyad is a YouTube Video Editor alternative for businesses that want to create video ads. It might not be the right video editor for individuals who just want to create and share their personal videos.
