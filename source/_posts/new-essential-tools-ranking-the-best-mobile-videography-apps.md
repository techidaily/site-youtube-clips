Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

On the other hand, being a famous YouTuber is a difficult task. Every famous YouTuber has gone through a long period of struggle and devotion. You'll need to make some investments, go through various processes, and so on before you can start making your first video.

## The Ultimate Checklist for Becoming a Youtuber

#### \- Make A Decision on Your Niche

The first step is to decide on a business specialty. Prepare a list of the sectors you'll be covering in your films. It's easy for your thoughts to wander when you're trying to cover too many topics and niches. Pick a few appropriate niches based on your interests and/or experience. For example, a fitness YouTuber would make videos about workouts and a healthy diet.

#### \- Describe The Purpose of Your Channel

What do you want to achieve with your YouTube channel? Do you want to make instructive videos to help others? Do you want to create how-to videos and tutorials to show others how to do things? Perhaps you simply wish to entertain others by sharing stories. Outline the goal you want to accomplish with your channel so that your videos have meaning. It will also help you get off to a good and consistent start rather than attempting to cover everything all at once.

#### \- Come Up with Content Ideas

\- Make A Content Calendar

#### It will be easier to maintain consistency if you have a regular schedule. It assures your subscribers that new videos will be released on the scheduled dates. It also includes a thorough timeline that you can use to plan your activities and keep on track

## Top 10 YouTuber in the world

Here's a list of the most popular youtubers below. The list is quite diverse.

#### 1\. Dude Perfect

Dude Perfect, a sports entertainment channel run by five guys from the United States, comes in at number 20 on the list. They began with basketball trickshot videos and have since grown to become one of the most popular YouTube channels in the world and the second most popular sports channel. The owners are Garrett Hilbert, Coby and Cory Cotton, Cody Jones, and Tyler Nathan Toney.

Dude Perfect, which has 56.7 million members, makes films on a wide range of topics; however, the sport remains a key focus. Drones, lasers, and, of course, trick shots are all covered on their channel. Dude Perfect's content comprises primarily of videos displaying various trick shots, stereotypes, and stunts.

#### 2\. Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg(PewDiePie)

There are 102 million subscribers to Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (PewDiePie). Felix was the most popular YouTuber in the world for a long time, and he made a lot of original videos. Indeed, he recently celebrated the tenth anniversary of his YouTube channel. He is a gamer who streams live footage of playing various games on his channel.
