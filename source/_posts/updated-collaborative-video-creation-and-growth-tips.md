## 1\. Choosing A Potential Partner

Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.

A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.

_Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?_

Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.

Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.

There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at **[Mr.Kate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A)** managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.

_Mr.Kate makes over **[MyLifeAsEva](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub%5Fconfirmation=1)**’s bedroom._

Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.

A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!

## 2\. How to contact a partner

Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the **About** tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says **for business inquiries**, click on **view email address**, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.

Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.

## 3\. Popular Types of Collab Videos

_[**Gabrielle**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ)talks about different types of collabs and how well they work._

In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:

#### #1\. Shout outs

In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.

I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.

#### 2\. Guest spots

This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.

For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!

_**[Matthias](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg)** gets **[NateWantsToBattle](https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle)** – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals._

Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.

Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.

#### 3\. Long distance collabs

_**[Lauren](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg)** is in Toronto and **[Aja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ)** is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense._

Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.

## 4\. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations

Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.

Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.

## 3\. Popular Types of Collab Videos

_[**Gabrielle**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ)talks about different types of collabs and how well they work._

In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:

#### #1\. Shout outs

In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.

I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.

#### 2\. Guest spots

This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.

For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!

_**[Matthias](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg)** gets **[NateWantsToBattle](https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle)** – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals._

Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.

Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.

#### 3\. Long distance collabs

_**[Lauren](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg)** is in Toronto and **[Aja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ)** is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense._

Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.

## 4\. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations

Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.

Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.

## 1\. Choosing A Potential Partner

Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.

A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.

![ Choosing A Potential Partner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg)

_Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?_

Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.

Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.

There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at **[Mr.Kate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A)** managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.

_Mr.Kate makes over **[MyLifeAsEva](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub%5Fconfirmation=1)**’s bedroom._

Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.

A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!

## 2\. How to contact a partner

Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the **About** tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says **for business inquiries**, click on **view email address**, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.

Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.

# FameBit Alternatives for Finding YouTube Sponsorships

Famebit is the most popular influencer marketing platform, but there are lots of sites like Famebit where YouTube creators can find sponsorships. The key is to find one where you won't be reduced to a database entry listing your channel’s genre and your subscriber count.

If you want to be valued for your talent then FameBit is a great choice, but it’s not your only choice. If you are serious about finding sponsorships and creating branded content then there is no reason you shouldn’t be on multiple platforms.

## 4 Alternatives to FameBit

Here are four influencer marketing platforms besides FameBit that cater to creators, not just brands.

#### **Revfluence**  

[Revfluence](http://www.revfluence.com/) promises creators they will be able to ‘create content on their terms’. They work with both YouTubers and Instagrammers.

A lot of big fashion brands like Calvin Klein, Madewell, and Gap can be found on Revfluence. This platform is a must if you have a lifestyle, beauty, or fashion channel.

On Revfluence you can browse through brands instead of waiting for them to contact you. You choose which companies you want to endorse, so you never have to worry about losing your integrity in the eyes of your subscribers. Once you find a sponsor, you maintain control over how you choose to collaborate with them.

**![Alternatives to FameBit - Tapinfluence](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-tapinfluence.jpg)**

#### **TapInfluence**

[TapInfluence](http://www.tapinfluence.com/) might initially seem more brand-focused than equal, like FameBit, because it makes you wait for brands to select you. You are not simply on-call for any brand willing to pay, though.

After a brand approaches you, you get to examine their offer and decide whether you would feel proud to be associated with them.

The main thing that sets TapInfluence apart from other platforms where brands approach you is their attitude towards influencers and the way they define influence.

Some creators get turned off by the word ‘influencer’, and it is easy to understand why. Your subscriber count is important when you want to participate in an ad campaign, but your subscribers are not just numbers and you are not some kind of puppetmaster ‘influencing’ them for monetary gain.

TapInfluence values authenticity and works with brands that hold that same value. Your ability to be genuine with your audience is never compromised because it is that honest relationship that makes you valuable to brands.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**![Alternatives to FameBit - Izea](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-izea.jpg)**

#### **Izea**

[Izea’s](https://izea.com/) motto states that they champion the creators. They value you for whatever it is you already do, be it ranting vlogs or educational content.

When you create your profile on Izea you connect your YouTube account, and any other social media account you open to use for branded content. You also describe your audience and state your asking price.

Brands distribute their sponsorship opportunities to select groups of creators based on what they are looking for. Sponsors may approach you, or you can take matters into your own hands and approach brands with creative pitches.

**![Alternatives to FameBit - ReadyPulse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-readypulse.jpg)**

#### **ReadyPulse**

[ReadyPulse](http://www.readypulse.com/) is different from both FameBit and the other platforms on this list because you do not join brands for specific campaigns, you become a brand ambassador.

The idea is that you continue being you – creating the same style of content you already do – but you also have a relationship with a brand that you openly support and advocate for. The trust your subscribers have in you is supposed to be extended to your associated brands.

This is excellent if you have the opportunity to become a brand ambassador for a company you respect and are excited to work with. You can get all kinds of perks – like discounts and early releases – from your partner brand, and there is no reason you should not want your subscribers to trust the brand that you trust.

It becomes problematic if you find yourself matched with brands you do not have total confidence in, although ReadyPulse does try to match brands with influencers who are already fans of them.

Only you can decide if becoming a brand ambassador is right for you and your audience.

 Do you know about any other sites like Famebit?

#### **ReadyPulse**

[ReadyPulse](http://www.readypulse.com/) is different from both FameBit and the other platforms on this list because you do not join brands for specific campaigns, you become a brand ambassador.

The idea is that you continue being you – creating the same style of content you already do – but you also have a relationship with a brand that you openly support and advocate for. The trust your subscribers have in you is supposed to be extended to your associated brands.

This is excellent if you have the opportunity to become a brand ambassador for a company you respect and are excited to work with. You can get all kinds of perks – like discounts and early releases – from your partner brand, and there is no reason you should not want your subscribers to trust the brand that you trust.

It becomes problematic if you find yourself matched with brands you do not have total confidence in, although ReadyPulse does try to match brands with influencers who are already fans of them.

Only you can decide if becoming a brand ambassador is right for you and your audience.

Famebit is the most popular influencer marketing platform, but there are lots of sites like Famebit where YouTube creators can find sponsorships. The key is to find one where you won't be reduced to a database entry listing your channel’s genre and your subscriber count.

If you want to be valued for your talent then FameBit is a great choice, but it’s not your only choice. If you are serious about finding sponsorships and creating branded content then there is no reason you shouldn’t be on multiple platforms.

## 4 Alternatives to FameBit

Here are four influencer marketing platforms besides FameBit that cater to creators, not just brands.

#### **Revfluence**  

[Revfluence](http://www.revfluence.com/) promises creators they will be able to ‘create content on their terms’. They work with both YouTubers and Instagrammers.

A lot of big fashion brands like Calvin Klein, Madewell, and Gap can be found on Revfluence. This platform is a must if you have a lifestyle, beauty, or fashion channel.

On Revfluence you can browse through brands instead of waiting for them to contact you. You choose which companies you want to endorse, so you never have to worry about losing your integrity in the eyes of your subscribers. Once you find a sponsor, you maintain control over how you choose to collaborate with them.

**![Alternatives to FameBit - Tapinfluence](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-tapinfluence.jpg)**

#### **TapInfluence**

[TapInfluence](http://www.tapinfluence.com/) might initially seem more brand-focused than equal, like FameBit, because it makes you wait for brands to select you. You are not simply on-call for any brand willing to pay, though.

After a brand approaches you, you get to examine their offer and decide whether you would feel proud to be associated with them.

The main thing that sets TapInfluence apart from other platforms where brands approach you is their attitude towards influencers and the way they define influence.

Some creators get turned off by the word ‘influencer’, and it is easy to understand why. Your subscriber count is important when you want to participate in an ad campaign, but your subscribers are not just numbers and you are not some kind of puppetmaster ‘influencing’ them for monetary gain.

TapInfluence values authenticity and works with brands that hold that same value. Your ability to be genuine with your audience is never compromised because it is that honest relationship that makes you valuable to brands.

#### **Izea**

[Izea’s](https://izea.com/) motto states that they champion the creators. They value you for whatever it is you already do, be it ranting vlogs or educational content.

When you create your profile on Izea you connect your YouTube account, and any other social media account you open to use for branded content. You also describe your audience and state your asking price.
