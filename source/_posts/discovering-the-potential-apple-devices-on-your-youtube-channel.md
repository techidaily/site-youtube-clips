There are a lot of reasons why you might want to use footage recorded from the screen of your apple device in your YouTube videos. Some people like to make YouTube tutorials about iPhone or iPad apps, others like to share their gaming experiences, and some need to use footage taken from their devices for presentations. Even if you do not think these kinds of videos suit your vlog, screen recording is a useful tool to have on your belt. You never know when one of your subscribers is going to ask you about your favorite mobile games.

Basically, there are three ways to record YouTube video on iPhone/iPad, including the built-in screen recorder (if you have [updated to iOS 11](https://support.apple.com/ios/update)), connecting iPhone to Mac and the last, some third party screen recorder. In this article, you will learn the three powerful methods one by one.

* [**Part1: Recording your iPhone screen in iOS 11**](#part1)
* [**Part2: Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector**](#part3)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## 2\. Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac

If you have a Mac then you already have all the software you need.

**Step 1**: Connect your tablet or smartphone to your computer using a USB port, and then open QuickTime on your Mac. In QuickTime select ‘File’ and ‘New Movie Recording’. A recording window will pop up.

**Step 2**: In the recording window there will be a red ‘record’ button. Next to that button there will be an arrow. Click the arrow and a menu of recording options will appear. In the section where it says ‘Camera’ select your iPhone or iPad. In this menu you can also choose whether or not to record audio from your device, such sound effects from games.

**Step 3**: Once you are finished in this menu click record to begin recording the screen of your device. Click ‘stop’ when you are finished recording.

Although you can download a version of QuickTime for PC, the PC version does not have a screen recording option. If you have a PC you will need to use the second method.

## 3\. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)

If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your device’s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.

**Step 1**: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at [Airsquirrels.com](http://www.airsquirrels.com/).Next, you need to have Apple’s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.

**Step 2**: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.

**Step 3**: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computer’s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.

**Step 4**: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.

You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.

If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.

## What Are YouTube Backlinks?

Links between other sites to your YouTube videos are referred to as YouTube backlinks. Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site's reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.

The content of a video with more backlinks is seen as more valuable by search engines than those with less, as each backlink adds confidence that the video is worth linking to.

The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks. Search engines often check popular videos for new backlinks leading to the quick discovery of new content.

The quality of backlinks significantly impacts the ranking and visibility of a given video. Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.

Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.

Links between other sites to your YouTube videos are referred to as YouTube backlinks. Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site's reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.

The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks. Search engines often check popular videos for new backlinks leading to the quick discovery of new content.

The quality of backlinks significantly impacts the ranking and visibility of a given video. Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.

Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.

## What Are YouTube Backlinks?

Links between other sites to your YouTube videos are referred to as YouTube backlinks. Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site's reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.

The content of a video with more backlinks is seen as more valuable by search engines than those with less, as each backlink adds confidence that the video is worth linking to.

The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks. Search engines often check popular videos for new backlinks leading to the quick discovery of new content.

The quality of backlinks significantly impacts the ranking and visibility of a given video. Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.

Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.

## Are YouTube Backlinks Important?

Yes. Backlinks are one of the vital aspects of SEO. They are essential to ranking well in Google search results, and they also help you stay ahead of your competition.

Backlinks act as a powerful source to attract your target audience. While getting people to your might be challenging, sending them to your other work is a breeze. You only have to include YouTube backlinks for free to do so. With 65% of people being visual learners, YouTube is a resourceful place for using backlinks.

## How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?

Getting high-quality backlinks can be challenging if you don't know how to do it. The good news is that there are many different methods that you can use to get links that will benefit your YouTube videos; all it takes is a little creativity.

With that in mind, here are some of the safest ways of getting YouTube backlinks for free for your videos.

#### Guest Vlogging

![Build YouTube Backlink with Guest Vlogging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-1.png)

If you have a large social media following or even just a few loyal subscribers on YouTube, consider using that to your advantage. Many bloggers and popular vloggers will allow guest appearances in their videos — as long as they also get something out of it. If you are a vlogger in a specific niche, you could guest vlog for someone well-known in your niche, or anyone with higher ranking videos than yours.

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

![Share your youtube video on social media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-2.png)

Posting original content on social media sites is also a great way to get high-quality backlinks for free. People will click your links, and this can help you to get more views and subscribers too. Many bloggers and vloggers often post the videos they feature on their social media platforms.

#### Web 2.0 Sites

![get youtube backlink via web 2.0 sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-3.png)

The use of Web 2.0 sites is a great way to get backlinks for your YouTube videos. Web 2.0 sites, such as Squarespace, Blogger, Blog, Weebly, and WordPress allow you to embed your videos. You can post original content on these sites, which will then link back to yours. So this makes them powerful links indeed.

Incorporate such websites into your marketing strategy and then target your keywords correctly to get more user engagement. In turn, both your site and embedded video will rank on the top page of search engines, meaning you will rank for that particular search query.

#### Pinterest Video Pins

![use pinterest video pins to get backlink](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-4.png)

Pinterest video pins are another great option. They are simply a link to your YouTube video placed on the Pinterest site. With over 320 million monthly active users and more than 200 billion pins saved, this is a great way to get YouTube backlinks for free. It also helps you grow your following.

Creating backlinks using Pinterest video pins can help you tell a story about your brand, idea, or project. Video pins attract and grab the attention of your audience using a cover image. What's more? You can create video adverts to advertise on Pinterest.

#### Unlinked Mentions

![unlinked mentiosn for youtube backlinks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-5.png)

The use of unlinked mentions means that whenever someone writes about a YouTube video without linking it back, you provide them with a link yourself; this is a great way to obtain YouTube backlinks for free.

**●** Questions: Is it safe to buy YouTube backlinks?

**●** No, it is not. You should not buy backlinks because it's against Google's Webmaster Guidelines. If you get caught, you will get a Google penalty for trying to cheat the system.

#### Video Title

The title of your video has a significant effect on your YouTube SEO. Including your target keyword in your title will help your video rank higher. A compelling title also drives a high CTR (click-through rate). However, you should avoid creating clickbait titles, as this can hurt your ranking.

![video title of youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-7.png)

#### Engagement

YouTube ranking also depends on how viewers engage with your video. If users watch, share, like, and comment on your videos, Google and YouTube will give them a priority. As such, the more engagement your videos receive, the higher they will rank.

#### YouTube Tags

Tags allow YouTube to know what your video is about. For this reason, your first tag should be the target keyword. You should also include variations of the target keyword when adding tags.
