## Part 1: Get More Views by Adding Shorts Video to the ‘Featured’ Section

To elaborate, generally, YouTube suggests you a video as per your viewing history, browsing statistics, and other such information that the streaming media giant collects over time. On the other hand, the ‘Featured’ videos are suggested according to what YouTube ‘thinks’ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a ‘Featured’ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the ‘Recommended’ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the ‘Featured’ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the ‘Featured’ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PC’s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as ‘Featured’ after its approval.

![Publish Added Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-featured-section.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos aren’t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding ‘#Shorts’ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the ‘Featured’ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channel’s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.

To elaborate, generally, YouTube suggests you a video as per your viewing history, browsing statistics, and other such information that the streaming media giant collects over time. On the other hand, the ‘Featured’ videos are suggested according to what YouTube ‘thinks’ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a ‘Featured’ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the ‘Recommended’ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the ‘Featured’ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the ‘Featured’ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PC’s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as ‘Featured’ after its approval.

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos aren’t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding ‘#Shorts’ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the ‘Featured’ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channel’s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.

YouTube Creator Summit has been held for several years. In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.

Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.

* [**S’well bottle**](#bottle)
* [**Branded slippers**](#slippers)
* [**Pins, pins, pins**](#pins)
* [**Denim jacket**](#jacket)

_Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures._

The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.

![YouTube Creator Summit Group Photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-2017.jpg)

_Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit. Turns out_ [_he’s a big fan of Lilly Singh_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGlcsogbAQY)_._

Thanks to Nick from nickatnyte, for example, we have a pretty clear picture of the kinds of swag YouTube was giving away.

_Nick talks about arriving in New York and goes through the swag box waiting in his hotel room._

There were some clues as to what the rest of the summit was like hiding amongst the swag too. Here’s what was in the box:

## 1\. A map of Dumbo

The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.

_Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo._

Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.

## 2\. Post Cards

One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.

## 3\. S’well bottle

S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45\. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention/conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.

## 4\. Branded slippers

To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.

![Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg)

_thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers._

## 5\. Pins, pins, pins

There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.

## 6\. Denim jacket

A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.

_![Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg)_

_Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit._

Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!
