 The problem occurs probably due to missing or corrupted USB driver files. Windows has built-in USB drivers, which allow you to connect USB devices to your PC without installing the drivers manually. But if the drivers are missing or having problems, after connecting the USB devices to your computer, you can’t use it directly. In this case, you need to install the drivers manually. There are different reasons causing driver files missing or corrupted. You’re likely to get this error especially if you’re using the streamlined system or upgraded the system to Windows 10.

3. [**Install the missing driver files manually**](https://dhgate.sjv.io/5g6yb2)

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 6) The driver will install automatically. You just need to wait for a while until the installation completes.

## Solution 3: Install the missing driver files manually

 If the built-in USB driver fiels**mdmcpq.inf** and usbser.sys are missing or corrupted, the problem could occur. So to fix the problem, you can try to install these two driver files. You can replace them with the same files on another computer. Follow the steps below：

 This solution requires you to have another computer with no such problem.

 1) On the computer with no such problem (The computer can run any Windows version), locate file **mdmcpq.inf** in**C:\\Windows\\INF.** Copy and save this file to an external drive.

 2) On the same computer, locate file**usbser.sys** in**C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers.** Copy and save this file to an external drive.
