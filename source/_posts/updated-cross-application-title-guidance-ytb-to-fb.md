03 [Tips: How to Adjust Vertical Videos Size](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?

Videos come in different sizes. However, one principle is standard in creating them, the vertical video aspect ratio (width to height). This refers to how you compare and create the video height to video ratio (how you intend to record and produce your video).

Ideally, it is what you and viewers will see while watching your video. To create a perfect video, any video creator should decide on the relationship between the video height and width.

When creating YouTube vertical video dimensions, the width is usually longer than the height. Most television videos have a standard ratio of 4:3 and 16:9\. However, social media videos are created using a 1:1 and 9:16 ratio.

![social media video dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

A smartphone can shoot vertical videos perfectly, but some media players like cameras require editing and adjusting the sizes to get the correct aspect ratio. Experts won’t have difficulties adjusting horizontally shot videos, but an amateur will. Fortunately, you can avoid taking unprofessional shoots by focusing on the frame’s center to capture your subject wholly without clipping important aspects. While editing Facebook vertical video dimensions and other social apps, the results could vary depending on the editing software. But you can rotate the video within the software to get the correct dimensions lest you get ugly videos full of black backgrounds filling the frame.

Most cameras and video recorders have inbuilt settings that switch to aspect ratio when you start recording. And the good thing is that you can adjust the settings to your desired dimensions in the settings section. If you are shooting a vertical video without a preset aspect ratio, then:

* Shoot gently without switching your camera horizontally, especially if you are capturing a narrow view.
* Avoid fast spans as it appears intense on the camera that could result in blurry animations.
* Focus on what you are capturing, and if need be, zoom in to capture every essential detail.

The importance of applying aspect ratio in videos is to ensure your images and videos have excellent resolution. This way, you have a chance to present (market) your idea professionally.

## Part 2 Vertical Video Dimension for Different Social Apps

Here is a guide on how to shoot vertical dimensions for various social apps –

### 1\. YouTube Vertical Video Dimension Guide

It is common for viewers to switch to YouTube and watch videos, and this is why you need the work on the perfect YouTube vertical video size.

![youtube vertical video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-6.jpg)

Usually, YouTube videos are recorded at a standard aspect ratio of 16: 9\. It means that you cannot customize the dimensions as this is this ratio is the default.

Though the 16:9 dimensions are standard, you can also shoot your videos using different ratios like 1:1 (square), 4:3, or 9:16 (vertically). In this case, your video will fit different YouTube videos on each device but will display white or grey padding on the frames by default.

Manually adding padding to your videos reduces the ability to adjust them to different ratios on various devices. If you are yet to switch to YouTube vertical video dimensions, you are missing to increase brand awareness.

If you are going live on Instagram, we recommend 9:16, while you can shoot in 1:1, 4:5, and 16:9 ratios for feed videos. For Instagram stories, we suggest 9:16, but you can always work around 1:1, 4:9, and 16:9.

## Part 1 What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?

Videos come in different sizes. However, one principle is standard in creating them, the vertical video aspect ratio (width to height). This refers to how you compare and create the video height to video ratio (how you intend to record and produce your video).

Ideally, it is what you and viewers will see while watching your video. To create a perfect video, any video creator should decide on the relationship between the video height and width.

When creating YouTube vertical video dimensions, the width is usually longer than the height. Most television videos have a standard ratio of 4:3 and 16:9\. However, social media videos are created using a 1:1 and 9:16 ratio.

![social media video dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

A smartphone can shoot vertical videos perfectly, but some media players like cameras require editing and adjusting the sizes to get the correct aspect ratio. Experts won’t have difficulties adjusting horizontally shot videos, but an amateur will. Fortunately, you can avoid taking unprofessional shoots by focusing on the frame’s center to capture your subject wholly without clipping important aspects. While editing Facebook vertical video dimensions and other social apps, the results could vary depending on the editing software. But you can rotate the video within the software to get the correct dimensions lest you get ugly videos full of black backgrounds filling the frame.

Most cameras and video recorders have inbuilt settings that switch to aspect ratio when you start recording. And the good thing is that you can adjust the settings to your desired dimensions in the settings section. If you are shooting a vertical video without a preset aspect ratio, then:

* Shoot gently without switching your camera horizontally, especially if you are capturing a narrow view.
* Avoid fast spans as it appears intense on the camera that could result in blurry animations.
* Focus on what you are capturing, and if need be, zoom in to capture every essential detail.

The importance of applying aspect ratio in videos is to ensure your images and videos have excellent resolution. This way, you have a chance to present (market) your idea professionally.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia is over for another four years and the grand finale of this tournament was really outstanding, and France won the World Cup for the second time after overcoming Croatia 4-2 in a thrilling final in Moscow. While the entire world is anxiously about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the football videos on YouTube are booming. In fact, the football-related searches on this platform have been soaring in the months leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, despite the fact that some of the most popular football clubs in the world are still ignoring how powerful YouTube has become.

We have produced the infographic below which clearly shows how popular football videos are on YouTube, so let's have a look at some of the mind-blowing facts we've discovered.

![top insights into football videos on youtube](https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/top-insights-into-football-videos-on-youtube.png)

## Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube

The football gods, like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Neymar Jr are making enormous amounts of money, in addition to having an iconic status in the mass media. Such state of affairs explains why YouTube videos with these superstars saw an 80% increase in watch time over the course of the last year.

Interestingly, the highest amount of football-related searches on the world's largest video sharing platform are coming from the South American and European countries. For example, France's young star Kylian Mbappé is a popular search in his home country, while videos of Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar are popular searches around the globe.

The number of YouTube users who are watching the game highlights has doubled over the course of the last two years, while the number of match recap viewers has increased 9 times since the last World Cup in 2014\. The live streaming content related to football is also gaining momentum, although it still isn't nearly as popular as the Trick Shot videos or Drills and Skills videos that saw a 6x increase in watch time in the last four years.

Furthermore, some of the most viewed videos on YouTube are football related, since Shakira's Waka Waka, the official 2010 World Cup song currently has 1.9 billion views. These statistics show how big the football audience on YouTube really is, and that brands and independent entrepreneurs have much to gain by including football related content on their YouTube channels.

Music videos related to previous World Cups have attracted 12% of women more than the videos that show footage of the Euro Cup, which clearly demonstrates that large audiences can be reached if the video doesn't include the actual gameplay.

As a matter of fact, football audiences are also largely attracted to gaming content, entertainment, and music videos since as much as 18% of the football audience frequently watches entertainment videos.

At the moment, sports videos are growing faster than any other genre of videos you can find on YouTube, including entertainment or music, while the branded partnerships in this niche are growing 111% faster than all of the sports videos combined. The window of opportunity is clear for all brands that support sports activities.

Furthermore, brand ads for corporate giants such as Nike, Gatorade or Addidas attracted millions of views, which means that the leading brands in the world of sports have recognized YouTube as a marketplace they can no longer ignore. Brands that want to gain more recognition on the international market can seize this opportunity to team up with influencers on YouTube to present and broaden the reach of their products.

Besides soccer that is currently dominating the largest video sharing platform in the world, basketball, extreme sports and winter sports also provide access to huge audiences and show promising signs that they can help brands and influencers generate more revenue. Popular YouTubers should try to include more sports-related videos on their channels because it might help them attract new followers and secure a foothold in a rapidly growing market.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia is over for another four years and the grand finale of this tournament was really outstanding, and France won the World Cup for the second time after overcoming Croatia 4-2 in a thrilling final in Moscow. While the entire world is anxiously about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the football videos on YouTube are booming. In fact, the football-related searches on this platform have been soaring in the months leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, despite the fact that some of the most popular football clubs in the world are still ignoring how powerful YouTube has become.

We have produced the infographic below which clearly shows how popular football videos are on YouTube, so let's have a look at some of the mind-blowing facts we've discovered.

## Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube

The football gods, like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Neymar Jr are making enormous amounts of money, in addition to having an iconic status in the mass media. Such state of affairs explains why YouTube videos with these superstars saw an 80% increase in watch time over the course of the last year.

Interestingly, the highest amount of football-related searches on the world's largest video sharing platform are coming from the South American and European countries. For example, France's young star Kylian Mbappé is a popular search in his home country, while videos of Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar are popular searches around the globe.

The number of YouTube users who are watching the game highlights has doubled over the course of the last two years, while the number of match recap viewers has increased 9 times since the last World Cup in 2014\. The live streaming content related to football is also gaining momentum, although it still isn't nearly as popular as the Trick Shot videos or Drills and Skills videos that saw a 6x increase in watch time in the last four years.

Furthermore, some of the most viewed videos on YouTube are football related, since Shakira's Waka Waka, the official 2010 World Cup song currently has 1.9 billion views. These statistics show how big the football audience on YouTube really is, and that brands and independent entrepreneurs have much to gain by including football related content on their YouTube channels.

Music videos related to previous World Cups have attracted 12% of women more than the videos that show footage of the Euro Cup, which clearly demonstrates that large audiences can be reached if the video doesn't include the actual gameplay.

As a matter of fact, football audiences are also largely attracted to gaming content, entertainment, and music videos since as much as 18% of the football audience frequently watches entertainment videos.
