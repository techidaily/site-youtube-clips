### 1\. Affiliate Marketing

![youtube affilate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/does-youtube-pay-monthly-2.jpg)

You might have come across YouTube videos where the creators talk about their favorite brands and add links to the platform for the brand. Well, that’s a form of affiliate marketing.

YouTube Affiliate marketing involves a creator reviewing a product like makeup, digital cameras, mobile phone, and lots more including services in their video. Plus, the links to the recommended product or services are usually added to the description of the video. So, once a viewer clicks on the link and purchases the product or service, the YouTuber gets a certain percentage of the money.

If you get an affiliate link to a product on a platform, you can create a video relating to that product, then in your video description, you’ll add the affiliate link there. So, when anyone purchases the product using your affiliate link, you’ll get your percentage off the price they paid. On average, companies will be willing to pay within 5% to 50% of the purchase price.

## **Conclusion**

 Every minute more than 300 hours of video content is uploaded on to the YouTube databases while 5 billion videos are watched every day. This only shows the metrics a content creator and a user have to deal with. Content creators need to protect themselves from the unending trolls and scams that hit every other channel and affect its userbase. While kids and sensitive portions of the human population have to maintain a safe distance from damaging and provoking content that circulates on the platform. To safeguard both ends of the platform I made this guide to streamline the process of **how to block YouTube channels** and videos from affecting your happy life.

## **Part 1: How to block YouTube channels on a computer (Mac & Windows)**

 Blocking will prevent the user from trolling and bullying you or your channel subscribers. This will effectively prevent them to comment and interact with your video content.

 The process of blocking YouTube channels on a computer system is fairly simple and will only require a minute if you know the name of the user you want to block. Follow the steps below:

* 1\. Log in to your YouTube account and look out for the account you want to block.
* 2\. When you’re in the account head over to the **About** section. You can find it in the toolbar beneath the channel art or banner.

## **Part 3: Block content on YouTube kids**

 YouTube Kids is the alternative version of YouTube’s video service dedicated and designed for kids. It’s entirely for children with all the content curated for kids’ education, family-friendly videos, and channels surrounding kid’s liking. The interface features colorful large images, and icons with five categories to explore from.

 The app filters all the content allowing only safe content and parental control to watch their children’s online activity. The app prevents commenting and any kind of cyber bullying-related issues. YouTube Kids need to be set up by an adult with singing into the app with their Google credentials. Parents can sign in and block channels or videos they don’t see fit for their children. Let us see how to block YouTube channels on YouTube kids.
