Smartphone cameras, especially the newest models, are capable of recording great videos. Depending on what kind of videos you make, you might not actually need a separate camera.

The majority of phone cameras record in full HD now, and some can even manage 4K. Where things get tricky is shooting in less than ideal conditions, i.e low light. You cannot make the same adjustments and customizations to your settings with a smartphone camera as you can with a DSLR.

You don’t have the same level of control.

But don’t worry – there are 5 **camera apps** that will allow you to [record videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and get even more creative with how you use your phone’s camera.

## Part 2: Best 5 Camera Apps to Record Videos on iPhone and Android

Let's dive!

* [**1\. Open Camera**](#open)
* [**2. ProShot**](#proshot)
* [**3\. ProCamera**](#procamera)
* [**4\. Sun Seeker**](#sun)
* [**5\. FiLMiC Pro**](#filmic)

### 1\. Open Camera – Free, Android Only

![open camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-camera1.png)

This camera app gives you control over your exposure, flash, focus, ISO, shutter speed, torch, and white balance. How much control you have is up to you. If managing all these things manually is a hassle for you, you can use its automatic or semi-manual modes instead of manual mode.

This is a great camera app to record time-lapses. It is simplistic compared to some of the other apps on this list, but it is also extremely easy to use.

### 2\. ProShot - $4, iOS or Android

![proshot app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/proshot2.png)

ProShot lets you adjust your frame rate, which is important if you want to shoot slow motion or time-lapse videos. You can also adjust your brightness while filming. One of the most useful features of this camera app is that it provides a real-time audio level meter, so you won’t be surprised by a poor sound recording when you watch your videos back.

### 3\. ProCamera - $5, iOS Only

![procamera app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/procamera3.png)

This is one of the most frequently recommended camera apps for iPhones. It makes it easy for you to adjust your focus, iOS, and exposure. You can also play with different filters and effects right in the app. One of the only downsides of this app is that some of its most useful features, like Lowlight Plus, are in-app purchases.

### 4\. Sun Seeker - $10, iOS or Android

![sun seeker app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sun-seeker4.png)

A lot of the time when you’re shooting with your phone, you’re shooting outside. When you’re shooting outside, the most important thing you need to keep track of is the sun. Sun Seeker is the perfect app for figuring out where the sun will be in the sky at any given time, which will tell you the best time to go out and make your video.

For more information on making videos with natural light, check out [Indoor Natural Lighting Tips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Besides just keeping track of the sun, Sun Seeker provides an augmented reality view of its path and how it will affect specific locations.

### 5\. FiLMiC Pro - $10, iOS or Android

![filmic pro app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmic-pro5.png)

This is probably the best all-purpose camera app available. It gives you exactly the same kind of control over your smartphone camera as you would have over a DSLR. You can manually adjust your focus, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, tint, and color temperature. There are even voice processing audio filters, so you can capture better audio while you’re shooting and have less to fix in post.

### Final Words

Because mobile cameras already perform so well, it can be easy to think to have more to adjust would only make things more complicated. However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.

Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality **camera app**.

* [**Part 1: Basic Rules You Need to Know Before Uploading**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube**](#part2)

## Edit YouTube with Powerful Video Editor

As a YouTuber, it is necessary to have an easy-to-use video editor, especially for beginners. Download Filmora for free and start your editing journey happily.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: Basic Rules You Need to Know Before Uploading

Clicking the ‘upload’ button is easy, but during the upload process, there are things you can do to help your video get views and maintain its quality. You should also keep an eye on the length and file size limits. The more basic things you need to consider carefully when you upload are the title, description, and tags of your video. These are part of what determines if and where your video comes up in people’s search results. There are also slightly more advanced video specs, like your video’s resolution, which will be helpful for you to understand as somebody who will be producing video content frequently. These sorts of specs will affect how long it takes your videos to upload and how much of the quality they maintain.

#### 1\.  How Long Can my Video Be?

By default, your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long. You can post longer videos by going to the upload page and clicking on ‘Increase your Limit’ at the bottom. After you have followed the steps to verify your account you will be able to post videos that are a maximum of 11 hours long.

#### 2\.  How Big a File Can I Upload?

Your file size was capped at 20GB, initially. If you follow the same steps for posting videos longer than 15 minutes then you can also increase your maximum file size to 128GB.

#### 3\.  Other Basics

After you click the ‘upload’ button on YouTube you are taken to a page where you choose a category for your video and add a title, description, and tags. These are all important for getting hits so you should put some thought into them.

**Title:** Keep your title under 70 characters so none of it disappears into a ‘…’. The best titles make people curious or elicit an emotional response. Terms like ‘video’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ are often typed into people’s searches so if they apply to your video it can help to put them in the title.

**Description:** A short synopsis of your video which includes your most important keyword. You have about three lines before your text is hidden by a ‘show more’ tab. If you are including the URL of your channel or other videos then you should make sure they are above the ‘show more’.

 **Tags:** Use a lot of them. These are the keywords and terms people will be searching for when they find your video. YouTube will suggest some after you start adding. A quick way to find good keywords to use is to search for videos similar to yours and check out their tags. A while ago YouTube started hiding video tags by default but you can download a free, YouTube-certified, extension for Google Chrome which will allow you to see them from vidIQ.com.

#### 4\.  Digging Deeper

To get your viewers to subscribe to your channel you will need to make sure your videos are not losing quality when you upload them. Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.

**Resolution:** the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080\. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.

**Bitrate:**  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.

Your **resolution** and **bitrate** should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.

YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171.

**Aspect Ratio:** the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9\. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.

## Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube

Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:

1\. Sign in to your YouTube account

2\. Hit the upload button

3\. Select your video type (Public, Private, Unlisted)

4\. Manage the upload

## Part 1: Basic Rules You Need to Know Before Uploading

Clicking the ‘upload’ button is easy, but during the upload process, there are things you can do to help your video get views and maintain its quality. You should also keep an eye on the length and file size limits. The more basic things you need to consider carefully when you upload are the title, description, and tags of your video. These are part of what determines if and where your video comes up in people’s search results. There are also slightly more advanced video specs, like your video’s resolution, which will be helpful for you to understand as somebody who will be producing video content frequently. These sorts of specs will affect how long it takes your videos to upload and how much of the quality they maintain.

#### 1\.  How Long Can my Video Be?

By default, your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long. You can post longer videos by going to the upload page and clicking on ‘Increase your Limit’ at the bottom. After you have followed the steps to verify your account you will be able to post videos that are a maximum of 11 hours long.

#### 2\.  How Big a File Can I Upload?

Your file size was capped at 20GB, initially. If you follow the same steps for posting videos longer than 15 minutes then you can also increase your maximum file size to 128GB.

#### 3\.  Other Basics

After you click the ‘upload’ button on YouTube you are taken to a page where you choose a category for your video and add a title, description, and tags. These are all important for getting hits so you should put some thought into them.

**Title:** Keep your title under 70 characters so none of it disappears into a ‘…’. The best titles make people curious or elicit an emotional response. Terms like ‘video’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ are often typed into people’s searches so if they apply to your video it can help to put them in the title.

**Description:** A short synopsis of your video which includes your most important keyword. You have about three lines before your text is hidden by a ‘show more’ tab. If you are including the URL of your channel or other videos then you should make sure they are above the ‘show more’.

 **Tags:** Use a lot of them. These are the keywords and terms people will be searching for when they find your video. YouTube will suggest some after you start adding. A quick way to find good keywords to use is to search for videos similar to yours and check out their tags. A while ago YouTube started hiding video tags by default but you can download a free, YouTube-certified, extension for Google Chrome which will allow you to see them from vidIQ.com.

#### 4\.  Digging Deeper

To get your viewers to subscribe to your channel you will need to make sure your videos are not losing quality when you upload them. Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.

**Resolution:** the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080\. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.

**Bitrate:**  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.

Your **resolution** and **bitrate** should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.

YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171.

**Aspect Ratio:** the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9\. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.
