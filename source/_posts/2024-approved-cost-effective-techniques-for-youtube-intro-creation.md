The platform is easy to use and widely accessible by millions of viewers and promoters. But there is one driving force for promotors – to hit YouTube 1000 subscribers. Attaining this number comes with endless benefits, as this article explains.

![get 1000 subscribers on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/get-1k-youtube-subscriber-1.png)

#### In this article

01 [Why 1000 subscribers?](#part1)

02 [What will you get when you reach your 1000 subscribers’ milestone?](#part2)

03 [How to get 1000 subscribers for your YouTube channel?](#part3)

## Why 1000 subscribers?

Subscribers hold a special place for your YouTube channel. They make it grow and spend more time watching than viewers who are not subscribed. You need 1,000 subscribers to monetize your channel. You’ll start earning as a creator and even apply for YouTube’s Partner Program. You can finally make money through ads, channel memberships, and subscriptions.

Here's the kicker! As the channel owner, you'll have more connections, and that means many viewers on the line. Of course, those who love what you do will tell their friends, and the channel goes on for more prospective subscribers and viewers. Nonetheless, you'll get enormous people to engage in a conversation with. The fun will only go on if more viewers are on board. Remember, you want to garner as many peoples’ opinions as possible. So, the best platform for this is your channel. Eventually, you’ll sell your brand and continue to grow in your market niche.

## What will you get when you reach your 1000 subscribers’ milestone?

Every creator is relieved when they reach the 1k subscribers’ milestone. Expect lots of goodies in store for you.

#### 1) You become part of the Opal club

![become part of the opal club](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/get-1k-youtube-subscriber-2.png)

It is good to feel honored as part of the Opal Club. This is a club reserved for creators whose channels have hit the 1,000 to 9,999 subscribers’ mark. And from the Opal Club, you get in-depth information on how to grow your community. Interacting with your viewers is a great avenue to escalate your channel.

It is also a quick way to get discovered. The Club will enlighten you on how to use metadata and collaborate to get more views.

#### 2) Easily apply for YouTube Partner Program

![apply youtube partner program when you reach 1000 subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/get-1k-youtube-subscriber-3.png)

1,000 subscribers is a ticket for you to apply for YouTube Partner Program. However, you also need to get at least 4,000 hours of views from your subscribers. But being that you have reached the 1k mark, you can take other steps to gain the 4,000 hours of views. These could be keeping up with publishing your videos, linking your Google AdSense account, and many more.

#### 3) Some congratulation email is good enough

It feels good to get a pat on the back for a job well done! You’ll get a congratulatory email for your efforts. That would be a great motivation for you to even aim higher the mark. Likewise, your ranking will start escalating as compared to a content creator who hasn’t reached the 1,000-subscriber level.

## How to get 1000 subscribers for your YouTube channel?

Now that you’ve seen what comes with 1K subscribers, our focus is to find ways to get to that number.

#### 1) Consider your audience first, not revenue

Remember, it’s the audience that will help you generate revenue. So, if you are a new creator, think of what you can give to your audience instead of what you are getting. What is of value to your audience is more important as they’ll hang around your channel for passion. You can take advantage and tune your ideas to what most viewers like to get.

#### 2) Put in resources to encourage subscriber sign-ups

Focus on getting traffic to your channel. There are several ways to encourage your viewers to subscribe, such as the use of animations on videos. It will not only attract their attention, but you'll realize many viewers coming over. Several resources are available over the net. Just find what suits you best, or use several options to see which gig fetches the most clicks.

#### 3) Properly advertise your videos

The best way to get more users to subscribe to your channel is to engage them. Make the videos enticing such that when a user views one video, they end up clicking and viewing the next 5 or 10 of your other videos. Let it be enticing and corresponds to the topic of the moment.

#### 4) Add a good channel description

A viewer should know what your channel is all about just by a glance. And the best part to put emphasis on is the channel description. Let them know what you are offering and how it will be of benefit. More so, make it simple to understand so that they don’t waste time trying to figure out what your channel is about.

#### 5) Focus on YouTube content that works

Put double efforts into the content that works for you. Check out which videos perform better than others and add value to them. Sorting them by "most popular video" will help you organize your lines and perform much better while focusing on valuable stuff.

#### 6) A call to action is good enough
