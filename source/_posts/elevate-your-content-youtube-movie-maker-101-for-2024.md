The reason why these content creators stay ahead is the urge to continue getting more subscribers. These channels have well-illustrated avenues for more potential subscribers. More so, they have several elements at the end-screen.

**They earn**  
Their YouTube channels are making some good bucks for them. It is estimated that PewDiePie makes about $10 million per year from his YouTube channel, while Justin Bier gets about $9 million from YouTube advertising.
