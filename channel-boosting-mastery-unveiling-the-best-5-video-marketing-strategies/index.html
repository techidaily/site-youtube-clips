More than 5 billion videos are watched every single minute on YouTube. And the ever-growing user base has propelled YouTube to the status of 2nd most popular social media platform in the world, and the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >second most visited website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after Google in 2021.</p>
<p>YouTube marketing is great for both businesses and individuals who want to make careers out of YouTube. Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p>
<p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p>
<p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p>
<h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p>
<p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p>
<p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p>
<p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p>
<p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p>
<p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p>
<h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p>
<p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p>
<p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p>
<p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p>
<p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p>
<p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p>
<h3 id="c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts"><a href="#c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts" class="headerlink" title="c. Try Giveaways and gifts"></a>c. Try Giveaways and gifts</h3><p>You can boost the viewership and subscriber count for your channel by setting up occasional giveaways or gifts to the viewers. Make sure that you set the winning criteria to have the viewers subscribe to the channel.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p>
<p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p>
<p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>! Till date, the video has over 14 million views</p>
<p>We do not advise you to try this out when you are just starting your YouTube career. Only venture out to such investments when you are stable when it comes to earnings.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback"><a href="#Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback"></a><strong>Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback</strong></h2><p>All your videos must be created with the audience in mind. However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience. Hence, it is imperative that you understand their likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>And the best way to improve your videos is to take suggestions from the audience themselves. You can ask them specific questions on how to improve your videos or what they want to see in your future creations. Take notes on what they have to offer and start building your content taking in those suggestions.</p>
<p>There is also another facet to incorporating audience feedback as it projects your YouTube channel to be responsive to the audience, something that is vital to building a strong and loyal viewer base on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources"><a href="#Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources"></a><strong>Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources</strong></h2><p>YouTube has made it easier for you to track the sources from which your videos are getting the views. Sign in to YouTube Studio Beta and the click Reach from the Analytics menu provided on the left panel. Now click on Traffic source types.</p>

                      alt="YouTube Analytics"
                ></p>
<p>In this window, you can see the different sources that led viewers to your video. Generally, it can be a mix of websites, YouTube recommendation’s, YouTube search, etc. Metrics like Watch Time gives you an idea of how long viewers watch your videos and Audience Retention shows how consistent they are at watching them. These are just two of the many metrics you can use to your advantage.</p>
<p>Analyzing YouTube videos will help you structure your future videos in a way that it is more susceptible to being clicked.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos"><a href="#Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos"></a><strong>Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos</strong></h2><p>You must have an eye on the metrics that your videos garner over the days. While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p>
<p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p>
<p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p>
<p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p>
<p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p>
<p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p>
<p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p>
<p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort. Having a rank tracker like the one from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://seranking.com/position-tracking.html" >SE Ranking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/tools#keywordranktracking" >Tubebuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be quite handy at times like these.

<p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p>
<p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p>
<h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios-2"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios-2" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p>
<p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p>
<p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p>
<p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p>
<p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p>
<p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p>

<p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p>
<p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p>
<p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!

However, the list had changed after 2020 due to the rise of a catchy kid song - Baby Shark Dance. This child song video has reached more than 9 billion views worldwide (still growing) and led to an online dancing fever - Body Shark Challenge.</p>

Most, but not all. Here’s our list based on the latest statistics about the most viewed youtube video ever available right now. If you want to know more about the channels or the YouTubers, you can use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the details of them.</p>
<p>Here is a full list of the most viewed videos on YouTube except for Body Shark Dance.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</a></li>
<li><a href="#part3">Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</a></li>

<h4 id="1-Despacito-Luis-Fonsi-ft-Daddy-Yankee"><a href="#1-Despacito-Luis-Fonsi-ft-Daddy-Yankee" class="headerlink" title="1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee"></a>1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</h4><p> <strong>Views:5.4B</strong></p>
<p>Despacito, the Spanish word for ‘slowly’, has broken all records in terms of the most viewed YouTube videos, reaching the milestone of two billion views faster than any other video, ever. It went on to reach 2.5 billion views faster than any other and now boasts more than five billion views, making it the most-watched YouTube video of all time.</p>
<p>As a song that’s almost completely sung in Spanish, the immense popularity of this video surprised everyone. Although hugely popular in Hispanic countries, Despacito was also top of the charts in 45 different countries, from Uruguay to Japan to Italy, so what made it so popular? Experts have speculated that its mix of Caribbean, Latin, pop, and rap gave it a broad appeal. Its earwormish nature, danceable beat, and perfectly summery vibe have propelled this fairly mediocre video to the heights of YouTube stardom that the rest of us can only dream about.</p>
<h4 id="2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth"><a href="#2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth" class="headerlink" title="2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth"></a>2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p>
<p>See You Again is a pretty cool song but is it really cool enough to be number two of the most-watched YouTube videos? Sure, the tune is catchy, and the video production is probably better than that of Despacito, but its rapid rise to YouTube stardom was still rather unexpected. Over 800 days after release, the video had clocked up almost three billion views, unseating the reigning champion of YouTube views, Psy and his K-Pop masterpiece, Gangnam Style, and today it’s sitting comfortably in the number two spot with 3.6 billion watches.</p>
<p>So, why did this tune go so viral? Was it the loyal Fast and the Furious fan base craving more time with the <em>Furious 7</em> soundtrack, or was it the tributary nature of the video paying homage to the late Paul Walker that was bringing in the views? In truth, it was probably both and also neither. The main influencer here was simply that a lot more people were using YouTube. Between 2015 and 2016, YouTube experienced a 17 percent increase in music video viewers and a total 25 percent increase in video streams. See You Again was simply in the right place at the right time.</p>
<h4 id="3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran"><a href="#3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran" class="headerlink" title="3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran"></a>3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p>
<p>If there’s one artist who has rocked the music scene more than any other in recent years, Mr. Sheeran is it. His double lead single from his latest album ÷ (divide) has been his most successful to date, racking up 3.5 billion views on YouTube to date with millions more added each day. It is Spotify’s most popular song ever with 1.5 billion streams and currently holds the record for the most number of weeks spent in the Billboard top 10. It’s was nominated for best single at the Brit Awards 2021 but was pipped at the post by Rag’n’Bone Man with Human.</p>
<p>But why does everyone love Shape of You so much? It’s a pretty simple song, with four basic chords and fairly boring romantic lyrics; what makes it so special? Some of its success is down to the physical construction of the music itself, with a pentatonic scale offering a tried and tested catchiness that’s impossible to resist. Even if you’re not a Sheeran fan, exposure has made this song familiar to you, being popular in clubs, pubs, restaurants and with buskers on street corners (not to mention certain Christmas adverts, right?). Add to all this the rise in general popularity of music videos, it’s clear to see how it’s become one of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time.</p>
<h4 id="4-Gangnam-Style-Psy"><a href="#4-Gangnam-Style-Psy" class="headerlink" title="4. Gangnam Style - Psy"></a>4. Gangnam Style - Psy</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>We’d be surprised if you could honestly say you’d never heard of Gangnam Style (and perhaps secretly tried a few horse dance moves), and Psy himself was undoubtedly pretty surprised too when he rocketed to internet fame in 2013. At its peak, this K-Pop legend was racking up 72 views per second and averaged 33 views a second for two whole years. Today, he’s fourth on the list with a total of 3.2 billion views (and yes, people are still watching).</p>
<p>Although it might seem Psy was inherently lucky when his song became such a huge hit, actually what he did was very clever. As well as combining a catchy tune with a ridiculously funny video, he intentionally left copyright off the video itself, almost inviting others to create their own parodies of the video, which they did in their droves. The dance he created was nothing short of genius, easily replicable by others all over the world. Despite being ‘K-Pop’, Psy’s own look is a world away from the polished pretty boy image of other artists in this genre, offering more of an anti-pop image from a guy who is clearly comfortable in his own skin. The result is the full package of measures, and deservedly places Gangnam Style in the top 10 most-watched YouTube videos of all time.</p>
<h4 id="5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies"><a href="#5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies" class="headerlink" title="5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies"></a>5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>A rather unusual entry for our number five slot, Masha and the Bear, as you might have guessed, is not a music video at all. It’s not even an official video, and to top it off it’s in Russian! Masha and the Bear is incredibly popular in Russia and is based loosely on an old Russian folk story, and since all 68 episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, three have surpassed the one billion view mark.</p>
<p>This particular episode is the crowning glory, having racked up 3.1 billion views over the years. The reason for this particular episode’s incredibly popularity is not entirely clear, although it is thought that perhaps the way Masha herself is portrayed has helped its success. Dressed in a folk costume with no legs on show and a headscarf makes the video acceptable to Muslim audiences around the world, which may have helped to spread its popularity.</p>
<h4 id="6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars"><a href="#6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars" class="headerlink" title="6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars"></a>6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>Also with 3.1 billion views, the inimitably catchy Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson has been his biggest hit to date. Boasting chart-topping success in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and many other locations around the world, the single won two Grammys, record of the year, and spent 14 weeks at number one in the US. So, what was it that got people watching, singing, and dancing along with Ronson and Mars?</p>
<p>Part of the success is undoubtedly down to the amazing lyrics of the song. From repeating how hot he is to namechecking Michelle Pfeiffer and Saint Laurent, these are feel-good power lyrics at their very best. The simple four-chord structure and effortlessly funky beat help its appeal bridge the generations, and the video itself just screams fun, fun, fun! Don’t believe us, just watch (the YouTube video, of course)!</p>
<h4 id="7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber"><a href="#7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber" class="headerlink" title="7. Sorry - Justin Bieber"></a>7. Sorry - Justin Bieber</h4><p> <strong>Views:3 B</strong></p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the young person’s sensation that is Justin Bieber had to make an appearance in our top 10 most-watched YouTube videos. He is, after all, the epitome of the YouTube generation, and has plenty of other well-watched videos in his archives. Selling 10 million copies in 2016 alone and topping the charts in 13 countries, Sorry has racked up, to date, 2.9 billion hits on YouTube, making it his most successful music video ever. So, what was the secret to this hit’s success?</p>
<p>Actually, we think that the reason for the success of this particular Bieber creation is due in part to the mismatch between the visuals and the audio. A languishing video requesting redemption from a lover would typically be shot in gritty black and white and feature the singer moping about feeling sorry for themselves. Instead, Bieber opted to recruit lively dancers from New Zealand’s ReQuest Dance Crew and furnish them with eye-popping outfits and lively dance moves to make up for the potentially depressing lyrics.</p>
<h4 id="8-Sugar-Maroon-5"><a href="#8-Sugar-Maroon-5" class="headerlink" title="8. Sugar - Maroon 5"></a>8. Sugar - Maroon 5</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.7B</strong></p>
<p>Maroon 5 had enjoyed a somewhat tumultuous career, achieving fame in the noughties, disappearing for a while, and then returning with outstanding hits such as ‘moves like Jagger’ and ‘One more night’. But this song, Sugar, has been their biggest video hit to date. Why? Well, the proof is in the pudding as they say.</p>
<p>This was a completely new concept video, shot in a variety of locations around Los Angeles and featuring Maroon 5 crashing numerous weddings. The reality is that the band did arrange things somewhat with the groom, although the bride and her guests had no idea. The resulting video is a joy to watch, as the assembled wedding parties express their shock, surprise, fear, and even anger as Levine and his crew pitch up and start singing.</p>

<h4 id="9-Shake-It-Off-Taylor-Swift"><a href="#9-Shake-It-Off-Taylor-Swift" class="headerlink" title="9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift"></a>9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p>
<p>After a long drought of almost a year, devoted fans of Taylor Swift were sick to death of hearing ‘I Knew you were Trouble’ on the radio five hundred times a day, so Shake it Off was almost guaranteed to be a big hit. Going straight into number one on the charts and staying in the Hot 100 for 50 consecutive weeks, its success on YouTube was even greater, boasting 2.5 billion views to date and making it the 9th most-watched video on YouTube. But how?</p>
<p>Swift is a master of generating internet attention. With over 100 million Instagram followers, Taylor set about whipping her ‘Little Monsters’ into a frenzy about the forthcoming release of her new single. As a result, Shake it Off was pretty much all the internet cared about for a full 24 hours. The lyrics tread a thin line between playful mockery of Swift and self-aware empowerment but are also super easy to memories and sing along with. Well played madam, well played.</p>
<h4 id="10-Roar-Katy-Perry"><a href="#10-Roar-Katy-Perry" class="headerlink" title="10. Roar - Katy Perry"></a>10. Roar - Katy Perry</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p>
<p>In 2013, Katy Perry took a short break out of kissing girls and liking it, as well as marrying (and divorcing) Russell Brand in order to release this banging new single. By the end of the year, Roar had sold almost 10 million copies and had topped the charts in 12 different countries. Its success on the radio was only surpassed by the success of the colorful music video on YouTube, where it has secured 2.5 billion views to date.</p>
<p>What’s not to love about this particular video, we ask? The lyrics are super empowering, you can run to it, dance to it, or just belt out your own roar alongside Katy. The visuals are awesome too, in particular the CGI animals and skimpy leopard print bikini, which undoubtedly helped its popularity. In a year that was tough personally for Perry, she hit back and produced this powerful song, showing once again that she is indeed a champion.</p>

<p>We’d be surprised if you could honestly say you’d never heard of Gangnam Style (and perhaps secretly tried a few horse dance moves), and Psy himself was undoubtedly pretty surprised too when he rocketed to internet fame in 2013. At its peak, this K-Pop legend was racking up 72 views per second and averaged 33 views a second for two whole years. Today, he’s fourth on the list with a total of 3.2 billion views (and yes, people are still watching).</p>
<p>Although it might seem Psy was inherently lucky when his song became such a huge hit, actually what he did was very clever. As well as combining a catchy tune with a ridiculously funny video, he intentionally left copyright off the video itself, almost inviting others to create their own parodies of the video, which they did in their droves. The dance he created was nothing short of genius, easily replicable by others all over the world. Despite being ‘K-Pop’, Psy’s own look is a world away from the polished pretty boy image of other artists in this genre, offering more of an anti-pop image from a guy who is clearly comfortable in his own skin. The result is the full package of measures, and deservedly places Gangnam Style in the top 10 most-watched YouTube videos of all time.</p>
<h4 id="5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies-1"><a href="#5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies"></a>5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>A rather unusual entry for our number five slot, Masha and the Bear, as you might have guessed, is not a music video at all. It’s not even an official video, and to top it off it’s in Russian! Masha and the Bear is incredibly popular in Russia and is based loosely on an old Russian folk story, and since all 68 episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, three have surpassed the one billion view mark.</p>
<p>This particular episode is the crowning glory, having racked up 3.1 billion views over the years. The reason for this particular episode’s incredibly popularity is not entirely clear, although it is thought that perhaps the way Masha herself is portrayed has helped its success. Dressed in a folk costume with no legs on show and a headscarf makes the video acceptable to Muslim audiences around the world, which may have helped to spread its popularity.</p>
<h4 id="6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars-1"><a href="#6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars"></a>6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>Also with 3.1 billion views, the inimitably catchy Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson has been his biggest hit to date. Boasting chart-topping success in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and many other locations around the world, the single won two Grammys, record of the year, and spent 14 weeks at number one in the US. So, what was it that got people watching, singing, and dancing along with Ronson and Mars?</p>
<p>Part of the success is undoubtedly down to the amazing lyrics of the song. From repeating how hot he is to namechecking Michelle Pfeiffer and Saint Laurent, these are feel-good power lyrics at their very best. The simple four-chord structure and effortlessly funky beat help its appeal bridge the generations, and the video itself just screams fun, fun, fun! Don’t believe us, just watch (the YouTube video, of course)!</p>
<h4 id="7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber-1"><a href="#7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Sorry - Justin Bieber"></a>7. Sorry - Justin Bieber</h4><p> <strong>Views:3 B</strong></p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the young person’s sensation that is Justin Bieber had to make an appearance in our top 10 most-watched YouTube videos. He is, after all, the epitome of the YouTube generation, and has plenty of other well-watched videos in his archives. Selling 10 million copies in 2016 alone and topping the charts in 13 countries, Sorry has racked up, to date, 2.9 billion hits on YouTube, making it his most successful music video ever. So, what was the secret to this hit’s success?</p>
<p>Actually, we think that the reason for the success of this particular Bieber creation is due in part to the mismatch between the visuals and the audio. A languishing video requesting redemption from a lover would typically be shot in gritty black and white and feature the singer moping about feeling sorry for themselves. Instead, Bieber opted to recruit lively dancers from New Zealand’s ReQuest Dance Crew and furnish them with eye-popping outfits and lively dance moves to make up for the potentially depressing lyrics.</p>
<h4 id="8-Sugar-Maroon-5-1"><a href="#8-Sugar-Maroon-5-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Sugar - Maroon 5"></a>8. Sugar - Maroon 5</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.7B</strong></p>
<p>Maroon 5 had enjoyed a somewhat tumultuous career, achieving fame in the noughties, disappearing for a while, and then returning with outstanding hits such as ‘moves like Jagger’ and ‘One more night’. But this song, Sugar, has been their biggest video hit to date. Why? Well, the proof is in the pudding as they say.</p>
<p>This was a completely new concept video, shot in a variety of locations around Los Angeles and featuring Maroon 5 crashing numerous weddings. The reality is that the band did arrange things somewhat with the groom, although the bride and her guests had no idea. The resulting video is a joy to watch, as the assembled wedding parties express their shock, surprise, fear, and even anger as Levine and his crew pitch up and start singing.</p>

<h4 id="9-Shake-It-Off-Taylor-Swift-1"><a href="#9-Shake-It-Off-Taylor-Swift-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift"></a>9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p>
<p>After a long drought of almost a year, devoted fans of Taylor Swift were sick to death of hearing ‘I Knew you were Trouble’ on the radio five hundred times a day, so Shake it Off was almost guaranteed to be a big hit. Going straight into number one on the charts and staying in the Hot 100 for 50 consecutive weeks, its success on YouTube was even greater, boasting 2.5 billion views to date and making it the 9th most-watched video on YouTube. But how?</p>
<p>Swift is a master of generating internet attention. With over 100 million Instagram followers, Taylor set about whipping her ‘Little Monsters’ into a frenzy about the forthcoming release of her new single. As a result, Shake it Off was pretty much all the internet cared about for a full 24 hours. The lyrics tread a thin line between playful mockery of Swift and self-aware empowerment but are also super easy to memories and sing along with. Well played madam, well played.</p>
<h4 id="10-Roar-Katy-Perry-1"><a href="#10-Roar-Katy-Perry-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Roar - Katy Perry"></a>10. Roar - Katy Perry</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p>
<p>In 2013, Katy Perry took a short break out of kissing girls and liking it, as well as marrying (and divorcing) Russell Brand in order to release this banging new single. By the end of the year, Roar had sold almost 10 million copies and had topped the charts in 12 different countries. Its success on the radio was only surpassed by the success of the colorful music video on YouTube, where it has secured 2.5 billion views to date.</p>
<p>What’s not to love about this particular video, we ask? The lyrics are super empowering, you can run to it, dance to it, or just belt out your own roar alongside Katy. The visuals are awesome too, in particular the CGI animals and skimpy leopard print bikini, which undoubtedly helped its popularity. In a year that was tough personally for Perry, she hit back and produced this powerful song, showing once again that she is indeed a champion.</p>

Gaining a place in the most-watched YouTube videos list is a great ambition to have, but you’ll be up against some stiff competition. Below, let’ take a look at the most viewed YouTube music video worldwide in 2021 and see what the secret to their success is.</p>

However, the list had changed after 2020 due to the rise of a catchy kid song - Baby Shark Dance. This child song video has reached more than 9 billion views worldwide (still growing) and led to an online dancing fever - Body Shark Challenge.</p>

Most, but not all. Here’s our list based on the latest statistics about the most viewed youtube video ever available right now. If you want to know more about the channels or the YouTubers, you can use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the details of them.</p>
<p>Here is a full list of the most viewed videos on YouTube except for Body Shark Dance.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</a></li>
<li><a href="#part3">Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</a></li>

</ul>
<h4 id="1-Despacito-Luis-Fonsi-ft-Daddy-Yankee-2"><a href="#1-Despacito-Luis-Fonsi-ft-Daddy-Yankee-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee"></a>1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</h4><p> <strong>Views:5.4B</strong></p>
<p>Despacito, the Spanish word for ‘slowly’, has broken all records in terms of the most viewed YouTube videos, reaching the milestone of two billion views faster than any other video, ever. It went on to reach 2.5 billion views faster than any other and now boasts more than five billion views, making it the most-watched YouTube video of all time.</p>
<p>As a song that’s almost completely sung in Spanish, the immense popularity of this video surprised everyone. Although hugely popular in Hispanic countries, Despacito was also top of the charts in 45 different countries, from Uruguay to Japan to Italy, so what made it so popular? Experts have speculated that its mix of Caribbean, Latin, pop, and rap gave it a broad appeal. Its earwormish nature, danceable beat, and perfectly summery vibe have propelled this fairly mediocre video to the heights of YouTube stardom that the rest of us can only dream about.</p>
<h4 id="2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth-2"><a href="#2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth-2" class="headerlink" title="2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth"></a>2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p>
<p>See You Again is a pretty cool song but is it really cool enough to be number two of the most-watched YouTube videos? Sure, the tune is catchy, and the video production is probably better than that of Despacito, but its rapid rise to YouTube stardom was still rather unexpected. Over 800 days after release, the video had clocked up almost three billion views, unseating the reigning champion of YouTube views, Psy and his K-Pop masterpiece, Gangnam Style, and today it’s sitting comfortably in the number two spot with 3.6 billion watches.</p>
<p>So, why did this tune go so viral? Was it the loyal Fast and the Furious fan base craving more time with the <em>Furious 7</em> soundtrack, or was it the tributary nature of the video paying homage to the late Paul Walker that was bringing in the views? In truth, it was probably both and also neither. The main influencer here was simply that a lot more people were using YouTube. Between 2015 and 2016, YouTube experienced a 17 percent increase in music video viewers and a total 25 percent increase in video streams. See You Again was simply in the right place at the right time.</p>
<h4 id="3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran-2"><a href="#3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran"></a>3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p>
<p>If there’s one artist who has rocked the music scene more than any other in recent years, Mr. Sheeran is it. His double lead single from his latest album ÷ (divide) has been his most successful to date, racking up 3.5 billion views on YouTube to date with millions more added each day. It is Spotify’s most popular song ever with 1.5 billion streams and currently holds the record for the most number of weeks spent in the Billboard top 10. It’s was nominated for best single at the Brit Awards 2021 but was pipped at the post by Rag’n’Bone Man with Human.</p>
<p>But why does everyone love Shape of You so much? It’s a pretty simple song, with four basic chords and fairly boring romantic lyrics; what makes it so special? Some of its success is down to the physical construction of the music itself, with a pentatonic scale offering a tried and tested catchiness that’s impossible to resist. Even if you’re not a Sheeran fan, exposure has made this song familiar to you, being popular in clubs, pubs, restaurants and with buskers on street corners (not to mention certain Christmas adverts, right?). Add to all this the rise in general popularity of music videos, it’s clear to see how it’s become one of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time.</p>
<h4 id="4-Gangnam-Style-Psy-2"><a href="#4-Gangnam-Style-Psy-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Gangnam Style - Psy"></a>4. Gangnam Style - Psy</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Making an incredibly successful YouTube video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the holy grail for any digital marketer. Gaining a place in the most-watched YouTube videos list is a great ambition to have, but you’ll be up against some stiff competition. Below, let’ take a look at the most viewed YouTube music video worldwide in 2021 and see what the secret to their success is.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-the-Most-Viewed-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#What-is-the-Most-Viewed-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the Most Viewed YouTube Video?"></a>What is the Most Viewed YouTube Video?</h2><p>Over the past couple of years, Despacito music video is undoubtedly been the most viewed video on YouTube. However, the list had changed after 2020 due to the rise of a catchy kid song - Baby Shark Dance. This child song video has reached more than 9 billion views worldwide (still growing) and led to an online dancing fever - Body Shark Challenge.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-Most-Watched-YouTube-Videos-in-2021-3"><a href="#Top-10-Most-Watched-YouTube-Videos-in-2021-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Videos in 2021"></a>Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Videos in 2021</h2><p>You may have expected this, but the majority of the most popular YouTube videos are actually music videos. Most, but not all. Here’s our list based on the latest statistics about the most viewed youtube video ever available right now. If you want to know more about the channels or the YouTubers, you can use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the details of them.</p>
<p>Here is a full list of the most viewed videos on YouTube except for Body Shark Dance.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</a></li>
<li><a href="#part3">Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</a></li>
<li><a href="#part4">Gangnam Style - Psy</a></li>
<li><a href="#part5">Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies</a></li>
<li><a href="#part6">Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars</a></li>
<li><a href="#part7">Sorry - Justin Bieber</a></li>
<li><a href="#part8">Sugar - Maroon 5</a></li>
<li><a href="#part9">Shake It Off - Taylor Swift</a></li>
<li><a href="#part10">Roar - Katy Perry</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-Despacito-Luis-Fonsi-ft-Daddy-Yankee-3"><a href="#1-Despacito-Luis-Fonsi-ft-Daddy-Yankee-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee"></a>1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</h4><p> <strong>Views:5.4B</strong></p>
<p>Despacito, the Spanish word for ‘slowly’, has broken all records in terms of the most viewed YouTube videos, reaching the milestone of two billion views faster than any other video, ever. It went on to reach 2.5 billion views faster than any other and now boasts more than five billion views, making it the most-watched YouTube video of all time.</p>
<p>As a song that’s almost completely sung in Spanish, the immense popularity of this video surprised everyone. Although hugely popular in Hispanic countries, Despacito was also top of the charts in 45 different countries, from Uruguay to Japan to Italy, so what made it so popular? Experts have speculated that its mix of Caribbean, Latin, pop, and rap gave it a broad appeal. Its earwormish nature, danceable beat, and perfectly summery vibe have propelled this fairly mediocre video to the heights of YouTube stardom that the rest of us can only dream about.</p>
<h4 id="2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth-3"><a href="#2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth-3" class="headerlink" title="2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth"></a>2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p>
<p>See You Again is a pretty cool song but is it really cool enough to be number two of the most-watched YouTube videos? Sure, the tune is catchy, and the video production is probably better than that of Despacito, but its rapid rise to YouTube stardom was still rather unexpected. Over 800 days after release, the video had clocked up almost three billion views, unseating the reigning champion of YouTube views, Psy and his K-Pop masterpiece, Gangnam Style, and today it’s sitting comfortably in the number two spot with 3.6 billion watches.</p>
<p>So, why did this tune go so viral? Was it the loyal Fast and the Furious fan base craving more time with the <em>Furious 7</em> soundtrack, or was it the tributary nature of the video paying homage to the late Paul Walker that was bringing in the views? In truth, it was probably both and also neither. The main influencer here was simply that a lot more people were using YouTube. Between 2015 and 2016, YouTube experienced a 17 percent increase in music video viewers and a total 25 percent increase in video streams. See You Again was simply in the right place at the right time.</p>
<h4 id="3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran-3"><a href="#3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran"></a>3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p>
<p>If there’s one artist who has rocked the music scene more than any other in recent years, Mr. Sheeran is it. His double lead single from his latest album ÷ (divide) has been his most successful to date, racking up 3.5 billion views on YouTube to date with millions more added each day. It is Spotify’s most popular song ever with 1.5 billion streams and currently holds the record for the most number of weeks spent in the Billboard top 10. It’s was nominated for best single at the Brit Awards 2021 but was pipped at the post by Rag’n’Bone Man with Human.</p>
<p>But why does everyone love Shape of You so much? It’s a pretty simple song, with four basic chords and fairly boring romantic lyrics; what makes it so special? Some of its success is down to the physical construction of the music itself, with a pentatonic scale offering a tried and tested catchiness that’s impossible to resist. Even if you’re not a Sheeran fan, exposure has made this song familiar to you, being popular in clubs, pubs, restaurants and with buskers on street corners (not to mention certain Christmas adverts, right?). Add to all this the rise in general popularity of music videos, it’s clear to see how it’s become one of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time.</p>
<h4 id="4-Gangnam-Style-Psy-3"><a href="#4-Gangnam-Style-Psy-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Gangnam Style - Psy"></a>4. Gangnam Style - Psy</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>We’d be surprised if you could honestly say you’d never heard of Gangnam Style (and perhaps secretly tried a few horse dance moves), and Psy himself was undoubtedly pretty surprised too when he rocketed to internet fame in 2013. At its peak, this K-Pop legend was racking up 72 views per second and averaged 33 views a second for two whole years. Today, he’s fourth on the list with a total of 3.2 billion views (and yes, people are still watching).</p>
<p>Although it might seem Psy was inherently lucky when his song became such a huge hit, actually what he did was very clever. As well as combining a catchy tune with a ridiculously funny video, he intentionally left copyright off the video itself, almost inviting others to create their own parodies of the video, which they did in their droves. The dance he created was nothing short of genius, easily replicable by others all over the world. Despite being ‘K-Pop’, Psy’s own look is a world away from the polished pretty boy image of other artists in this genre, offering more of an anti-pop image from a guy who is clearly comfortable in his own skin. The result is the full package of measures, and deservedly places Gangnam Style in the top 10 most-watched YouTube videos of all time.</p>
<h4 id="5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies-3"><a href="#5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies"></a>5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>A rather unusual entry for our number five slot, Masha and the Bear, as you might have guessed, is not a music video at all. It’s not even an official video, and to top it off it’s in Russian! Masha and the Bear is incredibly popular in Russia and is based loosely on an old Russian folk story, and since all 68 episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, three have surpassed the one billion view mark.</p>
<p>This particular episode is the crowning glory, having racked up 3.1 billion views over the years. The reason for this particular episode’s incredibly popularity is not entirely clear, although it is thought that perhaps the way Masha herself is portrayed has helped its success. Dressed in a folk costume with no legs on show and a headscarf makes the video acceptable to Muslim audiences around the world, which may have helped to spread its popularity.</p>
<h4 id="6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars-3"><a href="#6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars"></a>6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p>
<p>Also with 3.1 billion views, the inimitably catchy Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson has been his biggest hit to date. Boasting chart-topping success in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and many other locations around the world, the single won two Grammys, record of the year, and spent 14 weeks at number one in the US. So, what was it that got people watching, singing, and dancing along with Ronson and Mars?</p>
<p>Part of the success is undoubtedly down to the amazing lyrics of the song. From repeating how hot he is to namechecking Michelle Pfeiffer and Saint Laurent, these are feel-good power lyrics at their very best. The simple four-chord structure and effortlessly funky beat help its appeal bridge the generations, and the video itself just screams fun, fun, fun! Don’t believe us, just watch (the YouTube video, of course)!</p>
<h4 id="7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber-3"><a href="#7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sorry - Justin Bieber"></a>7. Sorry - Justin Bieber</h4><p> <strong>Views:3 B</strong></p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the young person’s sensation that is Justin Bieber had to make an appearance in our top 10 most-watched YouTube videos. He is, after all, the epitome of the YouTube generation, and has plenty of other well-watched videos in his archives. Selling 10 million copies in 2016 alone and topping the charts in 13 countries, Sorry has racked up, to date, 2.9 billion hits on YouTube, making it his most successful music video ever. So, what was the secret to this hit’s success?</p>
<p>Actually, we think that the reason for the success of this particular Bieber creation is due in part to the mismatch between the visuals and the audio. A languishing video requesting redemption from a lover would typically be shot in gritty black and white and feature the singer moping about feeling sorry for themselves. Instead, Bieber opted to recruit lively dancers from New Zealand’s ReQuest Dance Crew and furnish them with eye-popping outfits and lively dance moves to make up for the potentially depressing lyrics.</p>
<h4 id="8-Sugar-Maroon-5-3"><a href="#8-Sugar-Maroon-5-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Sugar - Maroon 5"></a>8. Sugar - Maroon 5</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.7B</strong></p>
<p>Maroon 5 had enjoyed a somewhat tumultuous career, achieving fame in the noughties, disappearing for a while, and then returning with outstanding hits such as ‘moves like Jagger’ and ‘One more night’. But this song, Sugar, has been their biggest video hit to date. Why? Well, the proof is in the pudding as they say.</p>
<p>This was a completely new concept video, shot in a variety of locations around Los Angeles and featuring Maroon 5 crashing numerous weddings. The reality is that the band did arrange things somewhat with the groom, although the bride and her guests had no idea. The resulting video is a joy to watch, as the assembled wedding parties express their shock, surprise, fear, and even anger as Levine and his crew pitch up and start singing.</p>

<h4 id="9-Shake-It-Off-Taylor-Swift-3"><a href="#9-Shake-It-Off-Taylor-Swift-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift"></a>9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p>
<p>After a long drought of almost a year, devoted fans of Taylor Swift were sick to death of hearing ‘I Knew you were Trouble’ on the radio five hundred times a day, so Shake it Off was almost guaranteed to be a big hit. Going straight into number one on the charts and staying in the Hot 100 for 50 consecutive weeks, its success on YouTube was even greater, boasting 2.5 billion views to date and making it the 9th most-watched video on YouTube. But how?</p>
<p>Swift is a master of generating internet attention. With over 100 million Instagram followers, Taylor set about whipping her ‘Little Monsters’ into a frenzy about the forthcoming release of her new single. As a result, Shake it Off was pretty much all the internet cared about for a full 24 hours. The lyrics tread a thin line between playful mockery of Swift and self-aware empowerment but are also super easy to memories and sing along with. Well played madam, well played.</p>
<h4 id="10-Roar-Katy-Perry-3"><a href="#10-Roar-Katy-Perry-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Roar - Katy Perry"></a>10. Roar - Katy Perry</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p>
<p>In 2013, Katy Perry took a short break out of kissing girls and liking it, as well as marrying (and divorcing) Russell Brand in order to release this banging new single. By the end of the year, Roar had sold almost 10 million copies and had topped the charts in 12 different countries. Its success on the radio was only surpassed by the success of the colorful music video on YouTube, where it has secured 2.5 billion views to date.</p>
<p>What’s not to love about this particular video, we ask? The lyrics are super empowering, you can run to it, dance to it, or just belt out your own roar alongside Katy. The visuals are awesome too, in particular the CGI animals and skimpy leopard print bikini, which undoubtedly helped its popularity. In a year that was tough personally for Perry, she hit back and produced this powerful song, showing once again that she is indeed a champion.</p>
